# What's Holding Back Your Productivity?
*This is a collaborative post. This post may contain affiliate links*

### There’s a common problem that people who have just got their business underway face: they’re not productive. There’s a reason why they say time is money, but really what should be said is “[productivity is money](/posts/cash-this-week.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.”

It’s not enough to simply be at the office -- it’s what you do when you’re at the office that counts. Fortunately, most of the biggest productivity drainers are well-known, and there are things you can do to make them a thing of the past. Below, I run through some common issues, and offer advice on how to solve them.

### You’re Not Awake
Some people pride themselves on being at the office at 8am or even earlier, but that in itself isn’t anything to boast about. What’ll make your early arrival worthwhile will be how ready you are for work once you get there. If you’re still half-asleep, then you’ll be sleepwalking your way through the day until mid-morning, or whenever your caffeine hits. 

If you really want to start your day the best possible way, consider having a morning routine that jolts you awake in the morning. For example, if you were to go for a run, [take a cold shower](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/freezing-cold-shower-challenge){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and have an energy-boosting breakfast, then you’ll be raring to go as soon as you walk through the office doors. 

### Wasting Time 
There’s a lot to take care of when you’re a business owner. But no-one says you’re the one who has to oversee all of the tasks, even if you’re the only member of staff. Instead, you can look at outsourcing some of the more complex, repetitive, or time-consuming jobs. If you don’t have specific training in, say IT, then it makes much more sense to find a third-party company to help, while you dedicate your time to the jobs that will move your company forward. It's also worth considering the services of a personal or virtual assistant.

### Chaotic Systems
Even if you’ve arrived at work alert and full of energy, and on your ‘to do’ list are tasks you know you can do well, you may still have issues. It’s not just the quality of your work that determines your productivity, but how you work. 

It’s important that you have the right systems in place, in order to ensure you can work efficiently. This involves things like having up to date computers and software, but also being organized. How much time do you spend looking for your important documents, for instance? If it’s longer than it should be, look at installing a document management system like [https://www.templafy.com/blog/techradar-pro-names-templafy-among-the-best-document-management-systems/](https://www.templafy.com/blog/techradar-pro-names-templafy-among-the-best-document-management-systems/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Once you’re well-organized, you’ll find you’re wasting less time and getting more done. 

### Too Much Work
It’s easy to get overwhelmed when you’re a business owner, especially in the early days. That’s why it’s important that you only take on the jobs you know you can comfortably handle. If you take on too much work, you’ll have so much to think about that you’ll be unable to focus properly -- diminishing your productivity at the same time.
