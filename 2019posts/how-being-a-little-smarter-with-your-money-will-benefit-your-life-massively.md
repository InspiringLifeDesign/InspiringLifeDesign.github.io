### I think we can all agree, money plays a pretty important role in our lives. Like it or not, we need money to fund our lifestyles no matter how simple or extravagant those lifestyles may be. 

Pretty much everything we do in life has some kind of financial connotation. The numbers in our bank accounts are essential, the higher the better!

There are generally two strains of thought when it comes to attitudes to money. Some people subscribe to the idea that life is too short, and it’s to be enjoyed right now, so spend it while you can; others feel as though you should be smarter right now, so that you can have a prolonged and guaranteed quality of life far into your future. While enjoying the moment is all very well in moderation, being a little clever with your finances will benefit you for the years to come, and give you some peace of mind. 

How can taking care of your finances now benefit you? Read on to find out four reasons I've identified:

### Less Stress
Money can be a real stressful business if you’re not in the right position. As responsible grown-ups, we have pressure on our shoulders regarding lots of different areas of life. If you work to build up a pot of savings and investments however, that’s one less thing to worry about for you and your [family](https://mydebtdiary.info/how-to-secure-your-familys-financial-future/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in the future.  

### Fewer Family Disputes
Did you know that money related issues are consistently quoted as among the top 10 reasons for divorce? Debt, lack of money, mismanagement of money or an inbalance of funds among families can cause disputes.

Focus on getting your finances in order. Areas to look at include: staying out of debt, building up an emergency fund and creating a savings and investments pot. At the same time ensuring that the split of money available to family members is equitable.

Don't forget to plan for all eventualities as well. It's essential to write a good will so that your estate will be passed on according to your wishes. Getting organised and making these arrangements will give you and your family peace of mind, and negate the need for a [probate solicitor](https://keoghssolicitors.co.uk/services/probate/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, saving time and money for your family in the long run.

Do this and you'll be significantly reducing your risk of disputes in the future.

### You’ll Have A Great Opportunity To Grow It  
The smarter you are with your money, the more of it you have to grow. The trick is to get your money making more money for itself, without you having to do anything.

Get your money invested in ISA's, pensions or regular stocks and shares accounts to take advantage of the historical growth that this offers in the long-term.

You can also consider making use of savings accounts, although the advantage of these will depend on the interest rates available. It's wise to look for interest accounts that offer more than the rate of inflation (if you can find it).

It's a good idea to make use of an instant access savings account for your emergency fund, so that you make some interest, but can also access it quickly should you need it.

### Your Overall Ability With Money Will Grow 
As you build up your wealth over time, it follows that you’ll have done a lot of critical thinking along the way. You don’t get to a good position with money if you don’t use your brain [wisely](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-few-ideas-to-improve-money-management_b_9019594){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} – it’s called ‘being smart’ with your money for a reason. Your competence with money will rise massively, and with that your confidence will increase to get better and better.
