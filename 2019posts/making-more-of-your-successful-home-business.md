### Take some time to focus on the financial side of things
One of the first things that you can do is to consider the financial side of things. As your business grows, so will your profit levels, and the need for investment may be able to be paid back, or the fact that you want to invest to grow the business more. This is when you may need to consider things like government schemes or even tax breaks to help you make the right choices. So considering something like [Metric eis tax relief](https://www.metricaccountants.co.uk/eis/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} from accountants that know what to do in this very circumstance will help you get the most out of the business finances and help you move it forward to continue with the success. 

### What about moving away from working at home?
Working from home may have suited you through those first months or even years, but as your business grows it can often outgrow your small office in your home. This is when you could look at finding yourself a new potential business premises to work out of. It could be shop on a high street, or even just a location that can be easily accessed where you can display what you sell or just meet with potential clients and customers in a more professional environment. 

### Is it time to hire your own staff?
Hiring employees could be your next big move as often as business grows there is simply not enough hours in the day for you to do everything like you may have been doing before. They may specialise in specific areas such as marketing or social media management. Or it could be to help [generate more sales](https://www.inc.com/michael-alter/small-business-strategy-when-to-outsource.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and meet with customers. This could free up time for you to focus on the areas where you can make the most difference. 

### Expansion when it comes to your products or services 
Finally, the last thing you could consider is expansion in terms of the products that you sell or the services that you offer. Adding to your range increases the potential for more sales and profits as you are giving your customer more choice. It could be a natural progression or you may want to expand in other areas. There are different things you could consider. 

Here's hoping that raising the awareness of these options helps you to grow your home business even further.
