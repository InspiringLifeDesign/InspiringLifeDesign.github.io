# The Essential Guide To Making Money From Your Blog
*This post may contain affiliate links*

### Many people decide to take the plunge and start their own blog. 

If you are tempted to make a foray into the world of blogging, you might want to check out this essential guide to making money from your little piece of the Internet.

With some thought and some business acumen, you may find that your blog is a lovely little side hustle, or may even become your full time income. Blogging was once the domain of those people who just wanted to vent their views, share their opinions with the world and write. Now, blogs have become more of a platform to sell services, share links and get paid to promote. Take a look at how you can make money from your blog.

### Useful Content
Travel blogs have been done a million times over and the market is now pretty saturated. Everyone loves the idea of becoming a full time travel blogger, and getting paid to jet set halfway across the globe, but the most prolific travel bloggers have been doing this since the early noughties. The reality is, there's no space left unless you have something new to bring to the table and you can hit a minority niche. 

Instead, focus on your talents and skills and think about what you can give to the world that people will be willing to pay for. This could be handy life hacks, DIY tips or even an eBook. Using your blog as a platform for these wares can be the perfect way to make money from your blog. By posting relevant content, coupled with your paid for content, you can emerge with a nice [little side hustle](/income-hustles/index.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

### Advertising
If your blog is enjoying a [large readership](https://blog.markgrowth.com/10-remarkable-ways-to-get-more-readers-for-your-blog-post-3b2118d8378f){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, companies relevant to your blog content may become interested in tapping this readymade market. This is where you can sell advertising space on your little patch of the Internet or even become a paid sponsor for a firm. For example, if you blog about the trials and tribulations of being a first time mum, a small startup that produces customised bibs and baby tees might be keen to get you to review their products or utilise a banner advert on your blog. This is entirely ethical as long as you are open and honest with your readership, and it’s a great way to earn money.

### Affiliate Links
By linking to other products in an online store, such as an Amazon book or an eBay product, should a reader follow your link and ends up making a purchase, you then can earn a commission on this sale. This is called [an affiliate link](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1397/affiliate-link){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and is more common than you may realise. It requires very little effort to set-up from you, and it is a simple way to earn some extra cash.


Starting a blog will rarely make you a millionaire overnight, if at all. Blogs can be lucrative, and you may even find yourself having to brush up on the new [Making Tax Digital](https://www.freeagent.com/guides/making-tax-digital/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} legislation from HMRC, but chances are you won’t be needing to register for VAT anytime soon. 

Remember, you should blog because it’s fun and you are imparting your knowledge or passion into the world. Any money that you can make from this online platform should be considered a bonus and can be used to top up your disposable income.
