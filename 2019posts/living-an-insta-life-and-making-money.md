Since it was first introduced nine years ago, the core values of Instagram have remained the same. It may have had a few updates and become easier to use, but it is still a way of using social media with photos and videos rather than chat. It is used so often that it is simple to forget the effect it has had on the way we relate to others, and how the world at large is perceived.

Seen as the first real rival to Facebook, it has turned many people into storytellers through pictures, and now some have an Insta-Life as well as their real one. Some of them are even making thousands of dollars showing off that life.

It differs from other social media platforms because it provides a comfortable space to be whoever you want, and for people who feel unsure of themselves it is a liberating tool. It is also a tool that can enable you to make money simply by selling your lifestyle...

### The Insta-Life Image You Project

A few pictures on Instagram portray the sort of life you lead, whether that is the truth or not. Take a picture standing next to a new [Land Rover Discovery Sport](https://www.harwoods.uk.com/landrover/new-cars/discovery-sport/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and it will be assumed that it is your car. It may well belong to you, but whether it does or not, that is the impression that your Insta-Life will give. What’s more, if you get enough followers, the company may even send you one of those cars for real!

The same applies if you post a photo of you standing with a group of beautiful models or hunky men. It may be photo-shopped, but everyone will think what a fun life you must have and they will want to follow you and then you can advertise to them and potentially [make money](/income-hustles/index.html){:target="_blank"} from sponsorship deals. If you have a perfectly groomed beard, a new hairstyle or are dressed in the most expensive of suits and dresses, your Insta-Life will look amazing and you will soon gather a few followers to see what you post next.

Your Insta-Life can be doctored and controlled and will make your life look a lot less messy than it really is, and to ensure that you have maximum opportunities to make money.

### Using Instagram Live
[Instagram Live](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/instagram-live/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} has become very popular since its introduction. Now that the app has a live video function, you can connect with your audience in real time. Used in conjunction with Instagram Stories, you can create a post that appears at the top of your follower’s news feed for 24 hours. This provides you with a huge opportunity to grab attention and rack up sponsorship deals and affiliate payments.

An algorithm controls it and if you want to stay at the top of follower’s news feeds, you need to keep refreshing your story.

When you go into Instagram Stories you have three options. There is the live video, which will disappear as soon as you finish the broadcast. There is the normal video or images that stay there for 24 hours, or there is Boomerang, which is a time lapse-like video made from several photos.

Take your pick and follow the instructions.

### The Story Of Life As You Tell It

With Instagram, you are telling the story of your life. It may be a little embellished along the way, but it has also inspired many people to achieve things they never thought possible. It is a platform that allows everyone to be creative and those who are good at it and serious about it, to make money. It is one tool you should definitely be looking at in your quest to become richer.
