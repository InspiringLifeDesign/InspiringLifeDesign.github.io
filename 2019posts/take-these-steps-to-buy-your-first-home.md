One of the biggest steps we can take towards financial freedom is buying our own house. Even though you might have to start off by taking out a mortgage on the property, one day in the future when you have managed to pay off the loan, you will be able to enjoy living in a home that is completely yours. Not only will you be able to do whatever you want with it, but you will also find that it is a worthy investment for your money.

But what exactly do you need to do in order to complete the purchase of your new house? Here are the steps you need to take.

### Save For A Deposit
First of all, you need to start saving for [a deposit](https://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/what-would-you-do-if-you-were-given-1-million.html){:target="_blank"} to put down on the house. Ideally, your deposit needs to be at least 10-15% but these days lenders are now more open to lending to first-time buyers with smaller deposits. Once you have managed to get a sizeable deposit together, you can then move onto the next step.

### Go House Hunting
Now it’s time for the fun bit - [house hunting](https://www.which.co.uk/money/mortgages-and-property/first-time-buyers/buying-a-home/house-viewing-checklist-a7bts1w28y3d){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}! It’s worth looking online and in the windows of local estate agents to find some homes that you like the look of. Once you have a shortlist, you should then arrange some viewings.

### Put In An Offer
Found a house that you really like? Now you need to put an offer in. First, though, you need to have a mortgage in principle from a lender. This isn’t a confirmed mortgage, but it’s a general outline of the kind of loan you are likely to be offered. Most estate agents won’t accept an offer from a potential buyer until they have one of these mortgage in principle in place.

### Find A Lawyer
Once an offer has been accepted, you should get in touch with some local [conveyancing lawyers](https://www.bannisterpreston.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and get quotes from them. Once you’ve got a few quotes, choose one to take care of all the conveyancing that is required in the purchasing process of a property. It’s the lawyer’s job to make sure that the whole sale goes through legally and that everything is above board. You will also pay your deposit to the lawyers when the purchase is near completion and they will then release these funds to the vendor.

### Get A Survey On The Property
Don’t forget to get a survey done on the property that you intend to buy. A building professional will take care of this and they will inspect the property to make sure there are no structural issues. Plus, you will need to get a valuation done on the house. Your mortgage supplier will require this to ensure that you are buying the house for a reasonable amount.

Buying a house can be quite complicated, but if you follow these steps then you shouldn’t go too far wrong. Make sure that you do follow everything to the letter as it is such an important purchase!
