# Live That Dream Lifestyle!
*This post may contain affiliate links*

Living the [dream](/posts/goals-to-accomplish-2019.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is something everyone should be doing, but for many, they're doing the exact opposite. There comes a time in your life when you realise you’re just not making the most of every day. You need something more, and you may even feel a telltale twinge of envy when you see other people living a different lifestyle to you. 

But the majority of people won’t actually do anything about it. All they’ll do is carry on as they are, with that niggling feeling in the back of the mind that life could be so much more. 

This post is a gentle reminder to nudge you towards living that dream lifestyle you’ve always wanted to live. There’s so many things that you can do to change the life you’re living at the minute. Why not have a look at the wanderlist below for some inspiration, and remember, nothing will ever change unless you **take action**.

### The Dream House
Everyone has different ideas of what they believe a dream lifestyle to be, though of course there will be similarities from one person to the next. One of the biggest ambitions usually revolves around the home that you would like to live in. With the volume of online real estate companies now, it's easier than ever to browse the housing market and see homes that you could only dream of! But perhaps your dream home could be somewhere unexpected. Take for example [Hunter Valley real estate](https://wyndhamridge.com.au/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, with Hunter Valley vineyards right on your doorstep! How's that for a dream location? Of course you may not be based in Australia, or want to emigrate for that matter, but the point is, think outside the box when searching for your dream home. You may find something within your price range by looking further afield or at more unusual properties.

### The Dream Job
Let me see your hand up if you've got an office job and you're tired of it! The day to day monotony is getting you down. Or you're in a more manual job where the hours are long with unsociable starts and inclement weather. Then of course there's the night shift workers and the weekend workers...Most jobs can feel like a drudgery after time. 

We spend a large proportion of our lives at work. Forgetting holidays, most people spend over 70% of their working-life days at work. When you sit and think about the prospect of having to work for such a long time, it really should get you motivated to think about finding a career that’s going to work for you. 

If we're talking dream lifestyle, then a career in something like travel and tourism could be the route for you to go down. Everyone likes a holiday, and if you really don’t have a fear of flying, you could think about something like becoming [cabin crew](https://confessionsofatrolleydolly.com/2018/04/24/50-things-i-wish-i-knew-before-becoming-cabin-crew/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, or even cruise ship crew. These are such good roles to safely see the world while earning money at the same time!

### The Dream Lifestyle
If you really want to live a dream lifestyle, you’re going to have to start living a life that makes you **happy**. 

Find a hobby, or find something to do that isn’t what everyone else wants you to do, but what really resonates with your heart. We often find ourselves so busy, but it’s never busy doing what we actually want to do! Take yourself out for dinner, go out for cocktails, go and stop in hotels, and just go and make the most of every day!
