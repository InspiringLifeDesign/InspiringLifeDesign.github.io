# 'Mundane' Expenses You Could Save Hundreds On
*This post may contain affiliate links*

### There can be a lot of mundanity to life, and much of it is to do with the money we spend on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. 

What makes these expenses so mundane is the fact that we *must* to fork out for them: no one can really live without their heating bill, or putting fuel in their car, not if they want to be healthy and happy with [their lot in life](/posts/10-years-left-to-live.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

So let’s focus on cutting them down a little, all for the health of your bank account, your future savings, and your peace of mind.

### Your Electricity Bill
What with all the new tech we’re bringing into our homes today, it’s no wonder a lot of us are struggling with paying the electricity bill. So, what can you do? [There’s quite a few methods more effective](https://www.which.co.uk/reviews/cutting-your-energy-bills/article/how-to-save-on-your-energy-bill/10-ways-to-save-on-energy-bills){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} than just switching the lights off. 

Change your bulbs. Unplug anything you’re not using. Insulate your walls and attic (or get them re-insulated). Switch your supplier. We’ve heard all of these ideas before, haven’t we? Well, it’s time to put them into practice, and shave off a good couple of hundred from your yearly bill at least! Think what you could do with a spare £200.

### A New Car
Well, not a really ‘brand new’ car - those are anything but a mundane expense! But if you need to get your hands on a new vehicle because your old one has broken down, been written off, or you’ve found a finance plan that allows you to upgrade, make sure you go second hand. 

It’s a market filled to the brim with good deals and choice sales, and there’s millions and millions of used cars just waiting for you to give them the once over. It’s a cost effective solution to your transport problems; even nearly new cars are going to be 30% to 40% cheaper than their new year counterparts. 

And you can always find yourself a reputable dealer, especially if you have secure access to the online world. Check out places like [https://www.affordable-cars.co.uk/used-cars](https://www.affordable-cars.co.uk/used-cars){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to get a proper scope on what’s out there. Shop around and don’t settle for the first dealership you come across! That’s a rookie mistake when you’re trying to save money. 

### The Food in the Cupboards
We need food to live, there’s no way anyone can get around that essential fact, which is why it can be so hard to try and cut down on the weekly food shop that keeps our cupboards and fridge/freezer stocked up. What can you do? Buy own brand items, plan out your meals so you know what you’re doing, even just head to the supermarket when you’ve got a full stomach! 

Regular bills are just that - regular - we need to pay them month on month, or year on year. Do yourself a favour, plan ahead so that you anticipate them and do your best to cut costs where you can.
