### When it comes to picking a niche for their business, most writers are put-off because they feel like they’re going to really limit themselves. Perhaps thinking that they won't get as many offers or find as many clients as a generalist would.

But if you think about it this way, if you’re suffering from heart problems, are you going to be looking for the advice of a general practitioner or a cardiologist? 

Obviously the latter. So, it’s the same in any industry. If, for example a client is looking for a writer who really understands the ins and outs of [Telehandlers](https://plant.autotrader.co.uk/plant-machinery/telehandlers){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, do you think they’ll be looking for a writer who’s a specialist in this area and has spent years working in that environment or would they be looking for a generalist who could potentially do some basic research on Google?

If, by now you’re not convinced by the need for all writers to have a [niche](https://www.businessblogshub.com/2018/10/tips-for-creating-content-that-stands-out-in-a-crowded-niche/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, then in this post we’re going to share with you some of the other benefits of having a niche.

### It results in better contracts
The writing world of business can be a tricky one where people struggle to make consistent money due to the fact that many clients only want to pay for the odd blog post here and there. However, if you’re a true specialist then you’re going to find that you’ll be attracting the kind of client who values long term writing. These clients are more serious about their business, and will work with you for a longer time. You’ll have proper contracts in place with them that last a lot longer.

### It results in better clients
Not only will you find that you’ll get clients who take the contractual side of things more seriously, you’ll also find that you’re going to attract better quality clients overall. They will be the ones who value good writing and understand what it should cost them - not trying to get you down on the price all the time.

### It results in more money
On the whole, specialists will be paid more, because they have a skillset that has taken a long time to build up. Whether through years of training or money spent, there’s an investment that the right clients will value. You’ll benefit from the time you’ve put in by getting paid more for your work than a generalist would.

### It results in less competition
One of the reasons many people avoid choosing a niche is that they think it’s limiting themselves, when in fact they’re just giving themselves far more competition by staying in a wider market - especially on price. Whereas a specialist will always have far less competition, and the more niche your area of writing is, the smaller that competition gets. 

When you're competing with every other writer in the world to get paid business, you can [worry far less](https://bemorewithless.com/worryless/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} by narrowing the pool of your competitors, and you do this by selecting a niche. It could be one of the most lucrative decisions you will ever make.
