### We are living in a generation where increasing numbers of people are opting to rent rather than buy. There are various reasons that people do this, but most people argue they are renting because they simply cannot afford to buy a house.

This makes sense and is understandable. The cost of living is on the rise and salaries don’t seem to be rising in step, meaning that many of us simply do not have the disposable income to commit to savings and getting our foot on the first rung of the housing ladder. But when it comes down to it, there are generally ways that you can achieve this. You just have to really set your mind to it. Here are just a few measures that you can take in order to get started on the journey to homeownership as soon and simply as possible!

### Ensuring You Have a Good Credit Score
The first step that you should take when preparing yourself to buy your first home, is to ensure that you have a good credit score. A [credit score](https://www.equifax.co.uk/resources/what_we_do/what-is-a-credit-score.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is also sometimes referred to as a “credit rating”. It is essentially a financial tool that professional lenders use to help them determine whether you are a reliable candidate for borrowing money or not. It is the main thing that will determine whether you are approved for financial services or whether your application is rejected. 

Generally, people worry about their credit score in regards to getting credit cards and small scale loans. But if you are planning on getting a mortgage, you need to remember that a mortgage is a huge loan, so you need a good credit score to be approved on this too! 

Many people fall into the predicament of assuming that lenders will think that they are reliable if they have never had to borrow money in the past. After all, it shows that you are responsible with your own finances and that you live within your means - you’ve been able to live independently and haven’t had to rely on anyone else to get by. Unfortunately, this isn’t how credit scores work. If you have no history of borrowing money, your score will automatically be low - just as if you had borrowed money and been irresponsible with payments. 

So why is this? Well, professional lenders need hard proof that you will pay them back if you borrow money. It’s all well and good managing your own money well, but they want to be sure that you handle other people’s money well while it is in your hands too! It can take a few months or even longer to build a strong credit score. So it’s best to get started with this process as soon as possible. You don’t want to start applying for homes, only to then realise your score is low and have to put your plans on the back burner while you rectify the situation.

### Considering Help to Buy Schemes
Once you have a good credit score, you can start seriously considering how you are going to go about purchasing your own property. Now would be a good time to look into help to buy schemes. These are schemes set up by companies like [Redrow Help to Buy](https://www.redrow.co.uk/incentives/help-to-buy){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. These companies often tend to implement measures that help make it easier for potential homeowners to get their hands on the property they want - such as offering properties with reduced deposits.

### Saving a Deposit
Speaking of deposits, the number of properties that can be secured with 0% deposits are on the decline. Nowadays, the majority of property developers or homeowners who are selling, demand at least a ten to twenty percent mortgage (you can see now why reduced deposits on help to buy schemes can be so tempting). So, you need to get saving if you’re planning on securing a property anytime soon. There are various steps that you can take when it comes to saving, but the main and (generally) most effective options include taking on extra work and reducing your monthly outgoings and expenses.

#### Taking on Extra Work
If you are already working a full time or employed job, it’s always worth asking your employer or manager whether there are any opportunities for overtime. Sure, it can be draining getting up extra early in the morning or staying after hours, especially if it feels like everyone else is enjoying extra time in bed or living a more active social life. But at the end of the day, it should be worth temporarily sacrificing these things in order to get the funds together to secure a home of your own. If there aren’t any opportunities for overtime, you might want to consider taking on an extra part time job with flexible hours (something casual like bar work or working in a retail store could do perfectly). Alternatively, if you have a particular skill or craft, you could register as self-employed and take on a little freelance work for extra cash too! On top of this, if you have any extra time, you can also engage in casual money making ventures, such as mystery shopping or [market research](https://www.peopleforresearch.co.uk/participant/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

#### Reducing Your Monthly Outgoings and Expenses
If you’re looking at saving a deposit for a house, chances are that you’ve already reduced your spending when it comes to your disposable income. These funds could simply be transferred into your savings account instead. 

However, it’s a good idea to remember that many seemingly "necessary" expenses can be reduced if you set your mind to it. Take energy bills as an example. You do need to fork out for energy bills in order to get by...electricity or gas (or a combination of the two) will ensure that your home is heated, you can cook, and you can wash and clean. But chances are that you can source your energy from a cheaper source than the one you are already using. Make use of price comparison sites to compare offers and find the best deal to suit your needs. This same principal goes for other essential expenses, like insurance, your mobile phone provider, [groceries](https://www.mymoneycoach.ca/blog/budget-grocery-shopping-tips-to-save-money.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and other day to day expenses.

As you can see, getting prepared for homeownership can be relatively difficult and you may have to make some temporary sacrifices along the way. But by managing your finances effectively, you should be able to get your foot on the first rung of the property ladder sooner rather than later!
