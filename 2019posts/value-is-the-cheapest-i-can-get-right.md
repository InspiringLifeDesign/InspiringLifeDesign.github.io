# Value Is The Cheapest I Can Get, Right?

### Value is the cheapest I can get, right? Wrong! 
When buying a product, you may be tempted to look for the cheapest you can find. Why buy a pair of trainers for £70 when you can purchase a pair for £40? Well, the cheapest pair of trainers isn’t always the cheapest. If your trainers fall apart within a few months, you will need to buy another pair, so you are technically going to spend more money. This is why you need to consider the value of a product when buying it, not just the price on the label.

### Cost vs. value vs. worth
Knowing the difference between cost, value, and worth is vital when making a purchase. So, let’s take a look at each one.

- **Cost**: ‘*Cost*’ can also be referred to as ‘price’. This is the easiest to understand. It is the amount of money you are going to need to hand over to buy something. For example, the cost of this T-shirt is £10
- **Value**: *Value*, on the other hand, is not a set number. Instead, you need to think of it as the value you place on something. How useful is this product or service going to be to me? How long is it going to last? How much do you love it? This will help you to determine whether it is worth spending a little more in terms of cost to reap greater value. If a CD is £5, yet you’re not a big fan of the singer, there’s no value in buying this, is there? You’re simply going to be wasting your money. However, if your favourite band’s CD is £11.99, it may cost more, but the value is greater, as you know you are going to enjoy it and get a lot of use out of it. Therefore, it is worth going for the more expensive option
- **Worth**: Now we come to worth. This is a term that we only tend to use when we are describing [big purchases](https://www.thebalance.com/before-you-make-large-purchases-2385817){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, such as a house or a car. This is because worth is a term that we use to describe something from a long-term perspective. For example, when we talk about the worth of a house, we think about how much we could make from a possible sale and how much it is going to cost to find a new property. Is it going to be worth it?

### You may spend more than what it says on the price tag
Another important factor to weigh up when it comes to cost vs. value is how much you are truly going to be paying for something. When you start to [track your progress toward financial freedom](/posts/financially-free-update.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, it becomes more and more obvious that hidden extras can make a huge impact on how quickly you get there.

More often than not, the price to acquire the product is not the only thing you are going to be spending money on. For example, you may purchase a new program for your computer. You may have to then spend time on learning how to use the product. Or, the program may require you to purchase add-on features if you are to get full use from it. When you buy a product, it is important to consider the overall cost for a true reflection of how much you are going to spend.

### So, does this product offer value?
To determine whether a product you are considering is value for money, there are some key questions you can ask yourself. These are as follows:

- Does the product have good feedback? What have previous customers had to say about it?
- How much do I really need the item?
- Is this product going to last me for a long time?
- Do I need to purchase anything else for the product to work or to get maximum value from it?
- Will it take me time to get to grips with the product?
- Do I already own something like this?
- Can I return the product if I am not happy with it?
- Am I going to realistically use the product often?
- Can I get the exact product for less elsewhere?

The last question is important. Just because we are encouraging you to consider value does not mean that the cheapest product cannot be the best value. 

### Value on a bigger scale
Of course, when it comes to bigger purchases, like properties, this value/cost difference becomes even more significant. If you buy a property cheap, and there is a problem, this doesn’t mean you then go and buy a new property. However, you're investing in something, so buying cheap could hurt you in the long run. For example, you may find a cheap new build on the market, or you may find a slightly more expensive [4 room resale flat](https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/hdb-apartment-for-sale/with-4-bedrooms){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. There are so many different factors that come into play here - will the new property have more potential problems? Where are both properties located? What about future value? What sort of profit potential is there? There's lots to think about and you should seriously consider the value when weighing the pro's and con's.

### Summary
When buying any type of product, simply looking for the cheapest one you can find is not an advisable approach. Instead, you need to think about the **value** of the product. If the price is right and you know that the product is going to last a long time and get a lot of use, then you know you are on to a winner.
