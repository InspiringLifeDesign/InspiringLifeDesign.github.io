*This post may contain affiliate links*

### Money is one of the things that people tend to get really tripped up on, and it is easy to see why that might be. 

After all, it is important to be able to look after your wealth as much as possible if you are to have a full life, but that is not something that everyone is going to find equally easy or straightforward. 

One of the things that many people will be aiming for when it comes to their finances is the experience of being [financially free](/posts/freedom-plan-part-1.html). But what does this really mean, and how can you make sure that you get there? In this article, we are going to investigate this concept a little more closely, so that you can hopefully get to the point where you feel as financially free as possible yourself, to enjoy all of the benefits that come along with that.

### Not Having To Worry
Naturally, one of the main things that you can expect from being [financially free](https://www.yourmoneysorted.co.uk/blog/how-being-financially-free-can-change-your-life){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is that you are not going to have to worry about your money at all. That feeling of not having to worry about your finances is one of the main reasons that people are trying to become financially free - and if you've ever had a taste of it, you will know how good it feels. 

Of course, there's no such thing as *absolute* certainty when it comes to money, and it's always possible to lose everything you have. But, you can at least get to the point where you are comfortable enough not to have to worry about affording your basics. That is something that most people would be happy with. Reaching a level of financial freedom will clear your worry for you, so getting to the point where you have a basic amount of money saved and invested is crucial.

### Having Fingers In Many Pies
A big part of financial freedom is having a lot of different places where you have stored your wealth. In many ways, this is even more important than the total amount of money that you have. 

The age old advice of not putting all your eggs in one basket comes to mind here. Where you are able to diversify in your income streams and your savings & investments, this will help you to feel secure in your finances, because even if one thing fails you know that you have many other things you can fall back on. 

This will likely mean that you have a number of investments in different places to rely on - one of the most important things to consider. If you take a look at this article on [‘Increasing Your Wealth To Protect Your Present And Future Financial Health’](https://minutehack.com/guides/increasing-your-wealth-to-protect-your-financial-health){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} you will see just how important it is to invest your money wisely - and in a number of different places at once. This is going to mean that you feel much more secure, and much freer with your money in general.

### Enjoying Your Wealth
All of your planning will be pointless if you never actually enjoy the wealth you have. How and when you will spend your money is an important topic you will need to give some serious thought to. 

[Enjoying your wealth means that you actually have a strong sense of what you want to do with it](https://www.splurgingonfreedom.com/5-benefits-financially-free/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and that you make a point of enjoying it as much as possible. If you have a lot of money, but never do anything particularly enjoyable with it, then it begs the question, what is the point of having the money in the first place? An obvious answer would be for the security and freedom that money offers, but the inability to fully make use of your wealth is a sign that you may not be fully experiencing everything that life has to offer, which may mean you don’t actually *feel* as financially free as you could. 

This may mean working through some feelings of guilt and fear in order to be able to enjoy your hard-earned savings a little more. But remember, you earned it, so try to enjoy it as much as you can.

### Having What You Need
It is important not to equate financial freedom with [great wealth](https://oneyeartofreedom.com/becoming-financially-free/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. The two are very different. As long as you appreciate that, you should be able to work out much more effectively what it is that you are going to have to do in order to experience real financial freedom. 

In fact, being financially free really just means that you have everything you need to live the quality of life that you have chosen. If you choose to keep your expenses and general outgoings low, you should be able to attain financial freedom easily enough.

The primary question you should be asking yourself is, do you know what you need? Or perhaps you feel a little out of touch with this question. If you're unsure on what you need to be comfortable, then set aside some time to get clear on this.

Everyone differs in terms of what they actually need, so this is really about getting more in tune with yourself. If you are happy with a very modest living, then that is all you need to aim for - and as long as it is what you want, you won’t have to feel as though you are not getting what you deserve. 

Getting in tune with what you *really* need might just be your key to becoming financially free in the truest sense of the word.

### Time
A resource infinitely [more important than money is time](https://idealrei.com/blog/being-financially-free){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Being financially free can afford you a lot of time, in fact this is one of the biggest drivers for people striving for financial freedom. The desire to have more free time.

So it may be worth considering whether there are ways that you can free up your time, before you hit your financial freedom goal. It's possible, that it's actually *time freedom* that you're looking for, and you might find ways to achieve this right now, before you necessarily have a full freedom-fund saved up.

Focusing on the concept of time a little more than the concept of money, you might find you gain a better sense of what is really important to you. You may even feel richer without a penny more in savings if you look at things from this alternative perspective. If you have all the time in the world, you truly are free.

### Being Mature
A big part of financial freedom is the willingness and the ability to make mature, grown-up decisions when it comes to your money. If you find that you often still make immature or silly decisions with money, then it might be a sign that you need to develop some financial maturity. 

Many people find themselves in this situation, so if this is you, you're certainly not alone. This is something that you're going to want to work on, to enable you to get to a place of real financial freedom and security. If you can manage to adopt a [mature approach to your finances](https://squirrelers.com/mature-money-decisions/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, it means that you are going to be in a much better situation in no time.

Whatever your reasons to be financially free, if you work hard at it, you too can get to that position soon enough.
