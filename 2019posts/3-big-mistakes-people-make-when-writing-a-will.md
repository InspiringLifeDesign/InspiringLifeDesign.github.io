# 3 Big Mistakes People Make When Writing A Will
*This post may contain affiliate links*

### Writing a will is something that we all need to do at some point. If you don’t have a will in place and you pass away, it can leave your family in a difficult situation.

They’re already dealing with their grief so you don’t want to add the extra pressure of sorting out your estate as well. In some cases, it can also lead to family disputes about who gets what and things can turn nasty. If you want to avoid all of that trouble and make things easier for your family, you need to write a will. But writing a will is quite a complicated process and people often get it wrong. If you’re starting to think about your will, make sure that you’re aware of these common mistakes.

### Starting Too Late
People often underestimate how early they should think about writing a will. If you’re still fairly young and in good health, you might think that you don’t need to bother. You can just wait until you’re in your 50’s and then start thinking about writing a will. But even if you don’t get sick, you could still be in an accident at any time. Really, you should be writing a will as soon as you start a family. Having a will in place is a good idea if you’re thinking about [early retirement](/posts/dreaming-of-fire.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, because you need to make sure that all of your finances are in order before you stop working.

### Picking The Wrong Trustee
Picking a trustee for the will is one of the hardest decisions that you need to make. You need to choose a member of your family that is going to be responsible for enacting the will after you’re gone. There are a lot of different factors involved in finding the right trustee and a lot of people just don’t know where to start (visit [https://www.philipstrust.co.uk/](https://www.philipstrust.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for more information on trustees). It needs to be somebody that you trust and has a good relationship with everybody else that is involved with the will so they can make the process as smooth as possible.

### Failing To Update The Will
If you just write your will and then don’t look at it again, it’s likely that there will be some big gaps in it when you eventually pass away. It’s important that you take any big life events into account like marriages because your will is invalidated if you marry. If you have another child, you need to make sure that they’re written into the will as well. If you’re not factoring these significant changes into your will, enacting it properly is going to be very difficult. Visit [https://www.howellslegal.co.uk/](https://www.howellslegal.co.uk/news/post/When-and-How-Often-Should-I-Update-My-Will){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for a list of circumstances when you need to change your will. As a general rule, you should be looking over your will every 2 years to make sure that it’s completely up to date. 

Your will is one of the most important legal documents you will create during your lifetime. Getting it wrong could be costly for your loved ones. Why not give yourself peace of mind, by not only creating/updating your will, but seeking the professional help you need to get it right.
