### Committing yourself to spending a lot of money each month is a scary prospect for anyone, no matter the type of employment. It’s hard to know what the future will bring, making it impossible to feel completely at ease when your money is in the balance.

This is a cause of stress for people all around the world.

The feeling of risk can feel ten times worse for those who work for themselves. Without a guaranteed salary coming in each month, it can sometimes feel impossible to save and improve your life. This is where support can come in handy.

If you find yourself in this kind of stressful situation, this post will help by exploring how you can manage your financial commitments when you work for yourself.

### Invoice Finance Companies
There are few things worse than sending out invoices and getting nothing in return. Sadly this is a position many small businesses find themselves in. [Invoice financing](https://www.comcapfactoring.com/blog/what-is-invoice-financing/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} companies can give you a loan (for a fee) which matches the amount of money you’re owed in invoices, removing the fear that you won’t get paid properly when you send documents like this.

### Savings
Even when you’re in a regular salaried job, it’s recommended that you have at least three months worth of living finances available. This will help you to afford your commitments when you have short months, while also giving you a backup in case you find yourself without any work at all. It might be hard to build savings, but the peace of mind is worth it in the long run. Begin by putting aside a small amount extra each month, you'll be surprised how quickly your savings add up.

### Spending Time, Not Money
One of the best ways to save money on the items you need to buy is through a little bit of research. There are plenty of blogs, forums, and other [information-based sites](https://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/inspiration/14-beautiful-content-heavy-websites-for-inspiration){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} around the web, each offering their own benefits when it comes to saving money. It’s worth spending time looking for the best deal when you’re choosing a product, as this can often save you a lot of money.

### Getting Some Support
Finally, another area to consider, is getting help with your finances. Even something like buying a car can be a challenge when you don’t have a traditional job, and so people often turn to companies like [Manchester Van Sales](https://www.manchestervansales.com/used-vans){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to get a financing deal for their purchase. While getting help may not feel like the route a businessperson should take, sometimes it can be worth it to save yourself stress & time.

Money is a challenge for everyone. Yes, even those people with plenty of it, still feel the pressure!

When you’re relying on your own self-employed or side hustle income to get through life, it may sometimes feel like you have to work even harder at money management and accumulation. But never forget the advantages that being your own boss can bring, and remember you always have the power to stay in control of your finances.
