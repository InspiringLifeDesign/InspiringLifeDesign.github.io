Financial freedom doesn't have to be an abstract concept or a pipe dream. Many of us fall into the trap of assuming we will never be financially free and independent of money concerns, but that doesn't have to be the case. Consider your life today, and ask yourself:

What do I need to do to achieve financial freedom?

If you know what you need to do, then set yourself [a list of goals to accomplish this year](/posts/goals-to-accomplish-2019.html){:target="_blank"}. At the time of writing, we are still near the start of the year, so there may be things you can do over the next few months to move closer to a life with less financial worries than at the moment.

And if you don't know what you need to do, consider the obstacles that might stand in the way of you and the promise of financial freedom.

### Do you need to reduce your debt?
Do you have debts hanging over you? Many of us do, from student loans to property mortgages. Then there are credit and store cards, and numerous other loans that have helped us buy those nice-to-have items. The longer debt exists in your life, the less chance there is of any financial freedom in your life. For starters, you need to **stop adding to your debt**. Stop using your credit card if you are financially struggling. Don't take out any further loans. Instead, [find ways to pay off your debts](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/credit-cards/blog/9-ways-to-pay-off-debt/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and finally release yourself from the vice-like grip they have over your life.

### Do you need to reduce your expenses?
Life is expensive, and some expenses can't easily be avoided. From utility bills to insurance costs, our bank accounts deplete quicker than we would like. While we can't avoid them, there are things we can do to reduce these financial burdens. An obvious way to do this is to use price comparison services. Even if you already know this, you may not have used these comparison sites yet, so **now** is the time to do it. Why pay more when you can pay less? 

You can also make lifestyle changes around your home, reducing the energy you use to cut down those bills further. And another good idea is to assess your living situation. If your home is costing you too much money, even after your cost-cutting measures, it might be advisable to downsize to a cheaper property. In the event you need a really quick sale, this fast-track [guide to selling your house](https://www.theadvisory.co.uk/sell-house-fast/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} might be essential reading for you, especially if you are struggling to cope at the moment. 

So, do whatever you can to reduce your expenses, as your long-term future depends upon you taking action now.

### Do you need to boost your income?
If you're inclined to live above your means, even when your monthly wage says "no!" then boosting your income could be an option. Even if you are narrowly getting by on what you earn, you will benefit from finding ways to help yourself. 

When was the last time you had a pay raise? It may be time to have a conversation with your boss! Go armed with how much value you are adding as an employee. Perhaps you could work toward a promotion which will ultimately mean more money. Or you may need to look for another job; one that offers you a better income than you are currently receiving. 

Another option is to [boost your income](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/make-money/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} by taking on a side-hustle or two. You might want to do these things anyway, even if you are earning enough, as that extra money can go into your savings or emergency fund to protect your financial future.

### Finally
So, what do you need to do to achieve financial freedom? From dealing with your debts to growing your income, do what is necessary to move you one step closer to a more prosperous life. Start today, instead of procrastinating and telling yourself you will do it tomorrow. A better future awaits you if you do.
