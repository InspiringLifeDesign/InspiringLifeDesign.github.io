### People in their 20s tend to be known for going out and having fun, for exploring the world, taking their first leaps into the great big wide world of business and starting to build a life of their own. 

What they aren't known for is being fiscally responsible, or having a crystal clear vision of what they want to achieve in life. Often it's difficult at this time of life to fully understand the degree of discipline required to make great things happen.

Instead, people in their 20's – especially in their early 20's – find themselves increasingly unsure about what they're actually doing, struggling to work out the proper balance between nights spent out on the town clubbing and days spent attending to advancing career goals - trying to be responsible.

A recent meme that's been going around features Millennials and members of generation Z wondering how to "adult" properly, and awarding themselves "adulting" points for doing things like setting up their own doctors appointments via the phone.

All of this being said, your 20's are actually an excellent time to work on saving up some money, to invest it wisely for the future, or to achieve [life milestones](/posts/what-would-you-do-if-you-were-given-1-million.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} such as buying your own home.

If you've got no idea how you could possibly make this happen, here are a few tips on saving money in your 20's that might be helpful.


### Consider renting an apartment with flatmates
Accommodation can account for a major proportion of the total outgoings of 20-somethings, particularly since people in this age bracket are most likely to be renting and are often based in large cities due to job obligations.

Of course, some people opt to get around this particular money-sink by living with their parents while saving up for their own place. This might be a worthwhile strategy – and it could certainly result in substantial savings – but it's not the kind of thing that everyone will be comfortable with, or will be able to manage.

Renting an apartment with flatmates is often one of the best ways of saving money in this area of life. Aside from the fact that it can lead to a pretty fun living situation, *assuming you're living with people you like*, and as long as you remember to respect each other's boundaries it's a money saver not only for rent, but for bills and often groceries, too.

Of course, you could just as easily rent an apartment with your romantic partner, rather than with your friends. In any case, living alone is highly likely to be the most expensive option.

Often, you'll find that you could afford to live in an attractive [condominium apartment](https://www.propertyguru.com.my/condo){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, when sharing a place with other people, for the same price that you would spend on a single bedroom micro-apartment on your own.

### Get over the party lifestyle quick, and socialise in less wasteful ways
If you look at the suggested lifestyle for the average twenty-something that tends to get portrayed in the media and in pop music, you'll notice a recurring theme of hitting the clubs, getting as drunk as humanly possible, dancing to the latest chart anthems and stumbling home to nurse an all-weekend hangover.

This kind of experience can be fun for a while, and it's pretty understandable that university students, and people who have just hit legal drinking age, will experiment with this kind of full-on party lifestyle in order to see what it's all about.

But, if you're in your late 20s, and you still spend every weekend getting blackout drunk, that's a sign that you're on the wrong track, and that you're living in a pretty unproductive and unhealthy way.

This kind of party lifestyle is obviously pretty bad for your health, is generally pretty bad for your sense of self-worth, isn't necessarily great for your ability to nurture deep connections with people, and to top it all off, it can get really expensive.

Living a party lifestyle means splashing out a hefty chunk of change at bars and clubs on a regular basis, and also means losing entire days of [peak productivity](https://www.fastcompany.com/90299580/how-to-work-at-peak-productivity-and-know-when-to-take-a-break){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} due to increasingly worse hangovers.

One of the best things you can do in order to save money in your 20's, is to get over the party lifestyle quick, and begin socialising in less wasteful ways.

You could consider forming a social group where you take it in turns to host dinner parties, games nights, cocktail parties - the list goes on. Or consider taking advantage of the full weekend days you can enjoy when not out late clubbing, by joining a morning work-out club, going for a fresh morning walk or turning your attention to growing a profitable side hustle that will help boost your savings for your future.


### Find your life partner
If you can [find](https://www.eharmony.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} your life partner when you're still in your 20's, that will do a lot of good for your overall sense of well-being in the world, and it can also do a lot of good for your financial well-being as well.

Obviously it's the emotional side of things that's important for romantic relationships, but a natural up-side of being in a relationship is that you may begin to share costs, or indeed save on costs together - simply as a result of doing things together. When you have a serious and committed romantic partner by your side, not only can you share general living expenses, but you are also significantly more likely to be properly psychologically and emotionally motivated to remain on a productive path through life.

It's well known that healthy relationships can change each member of the relationship for the better, and encourage them to be more upright and focused than they otherwise would be.

Suffice to say, that's a pretty good position to be in.


### Work diligently at your day job, but begin developing a side hustle as well
The first proper job you start in your 20's is unlikely to be the pinnacle of your career ambitions, it's probably not going to be a completely joyful experience every day.

All the same, the best thing you can do is to work diligently at your day job – whatever it is – and try your best to stand out in everything you do. Among other things, this will help you to build a strong resume, with excellent references, and it can also get you noticed by people who matter. Getting fast tracked into meaningful roles that you had never previously considered could be the boost your career really needs.

In your 20's don't cruise along – work as hard as you can manage, this is a time when you have the energy, enthusiasm and brain power to make your biggest advances.

You may also want to consider developing a side hustle, with whatever time and energy you have left. Side hustles – when they work out – can serve as the basis for successful small businesses and entrepreneurial ventures. When they don't work out – they still contain important learning experiences, and make you savvier at what you do.

There are [many posts](/income-hustles/index.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on my site which can give you more tips and advice on getting started with side hustles such as online book publishing and blogging.
