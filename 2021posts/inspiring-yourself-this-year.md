### February might be a little late to come up with your New Year's resolution, but many of us fail in January, and February has been proven to be a more effective time to make this change. 
Today I want to talk about how you can inspire yourself to be better this year with small things you can do to motivate yourself toward real improvement. Whether it be for your job, relationship, or your [passion](/posts/what-new-side-hustle-should-you-start-this-year.html) - I want to motivate you and help you achieve your dreams this year and beyond. 

### Clear out your house 
One of the first things you should do this week if you want to make a positive change to your life is clear out the clutter from your house. This might not seem like it will do anything for you, but a clear house is a clear mind and you will feel so much more motivated and ready to work and do all the other things you want to do. If you struggle to motivate yourself, particularly in lockdown, doing a job like this can make all the difference and will help you inspire yourself to do more. 

### Map out your dreams 
Next it's time to sit down with a pen and paper and map out your dreams. It could be a dream for your life, your career, or something else - but mapping out the steps you need to take to get you to where you want to be will help you visualise your path and will inspire you to start moving towards it. It is easy for us to sit and say ‘I want to be here in 5 years’ but many of us stop there and don’t start taking steps to reach that goal. If it is a job; consider what skills or qualifications you need to reach your dream job and start studying now. Don’t allow yourself to fall behind and get stuck in limbo. Take action and start to work hard towards achieving your dreams. 

### Move forward
This may be tough love, but you should also take stock of those things you've been putting off doing because they scare you. Like quitting your unfulfilling job; visiting the [divorce solicitors](https://austinkemp.co.uk/contact/divorce-lawyers-and-family-law-solicitors-manchester/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}; and moving out of your pokey house. One of the best ways to inspire yourself to change is to get rid of the past and look towards the future. Leave your mistakes behind now and start motivating yourself to pursue what you want in life. It is so important for you to do this and it will make a huge difference to your mood and your ability to try. 

### Keep quotes close by 
Inspirational quotes can be more effective than you think, and one of the ways to constantly motivate yourself is to keep quotes on your phone or on your wall where you can see them each and every day. Having a quote there in front of you each day will remind you of what you want to work towards and how you plan to get there. It will motivate you when you see it and hopefully get you in that positive mindset for the day ahead. Better still consider using a daily affirmation. Affirmations are best when started with the powerful words "I am", such as "I am fearless", "I am organised" and "I am changing my life today!"
