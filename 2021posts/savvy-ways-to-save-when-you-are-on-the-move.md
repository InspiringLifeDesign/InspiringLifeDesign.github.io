### Are you thinking about moving home in the near future? If so, then there’s a lot of choices and decisions ahead of you. 
It’s important that you do take the costs into account. There’s more costs to consider than just the initial expense of buying a new property. But there’s also some [fantastic ways to save](/posts/cash-this-week.html). So, let’s explore the best and brightest solutions. 

### Get A Few Quotes
You’ll need to use a few services when you are moving home. This includes everything from the moving team to the estate agents that you use to market the property. That’s why it’s important to make sure that you get quotes from various companies. Doing so will provide you with a baseline cost that you should expect to pay. Do make sure that when you get different quotes for these services, the company is being transparent with pricing. The first quoted cost should be exactly what you pay when the service is complete. 

### Bid On Movers

One of the most expensive costs moving home can be paying the moving team themselves. This is often due to the fact that you can be brow beaten into paying extra fees on top of the initial service. Home movers often assume that moving teams have the upper hand here but that’s not the case. You can think about using a bidding solution. The right bidding service will ensure that you gain complete control over how much you spend. How does this work? As a customer, you use a service like Shiply. Companies use the same solution when they want to know [how to find shipments to bid on](https://www.shiply.com/us/shipping-bids){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. They offer you different quotes and you choose the one that provides the right value for your budget.

### DIY 
You might also want to think about DIYing some of the parts of moving home. For instance, it’s important that you do complete repairs on the property before you put the house up for sale. The temptation will be to use a professional service. However, this is always going to add a lot to your costs. Instead, you should think about completing the work yourself and using guides online to help you along the way. 

### Get Boxes For Free
Finally, you’re going to need a [lot of boxes](https://www.fantastic-removals.co.uk/blog/get-free-boxes-for-moving/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} when you’re moving home. This is essential to keep your items and furniture safe during the move. It’s crazy how much buying these boxes can be, but there are ways to save. You can think about checking out your local superstore. These shops always have boxes that just end up being recycled. If you ask politely, you’ll probably find that they are more than happy to give them to you and help with your move. This is a huge benefit as the boxes are often designed specifically for heavy items. 

I hope this helps you understand that there are some fantastic ways to save when you’re moving home. Doing so will leave you with more funds to alter your new home or just build up your savings. It’s entirely your choice.
