### We all have big dreams, but not all of us will see them become a reality, and that isn’t because we aren’t capable of it or because our dreams are impossible; often it’s because we don’t really believe that we can, so we don’t even try.

If you want to make your dreams a reality, you first need to believe that it can happen, then you may want to do some or all of the following…

### Set goals
If you don’t have goals, you are likely to drift aimlessly, which will make achieving your dream far more difficult. Ideally, you should have a mixture of goals that are easy to achieve, to spur you on and keep you motivated, and some that are more difficult to give you something to strive for. So, sit down, and start listing a few goals that will get you to your dream right now. 

### Get comfortable with discomfort
Whether your dreams mean giving up your job to set up a brand new business with all the risk that entails or moving into [student accommodation](https://axostudent.co.uk/properties/axo-islington/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} halfway across the country to get the education you need for that dream job, you need to get comfortable with moving out of your comfort zone if you want to achieve those big dreams in life.

### Work hard
This seems so obvious, but so many people think they can get their dream job or [start living their ideal life](/transformation/books/index.html) by simply wishing for it - that rarely works well. Of course, visualising your dreams does help, if only to get you in the right frame of mind, but you also have to put things into motion and work really hard if you want to succeed - it really is that simple.

### Do something every day
Doing something towards your dream every day, even if it’s only adding a new image to your [vision board](https://www.thewisdompost.com/law-of-attraction/vision-board/top-15-benefits-of-having-your-own-vision-board/1663){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or emailing one company your resume, will help you to build the momentum that you need to succeed in the long term.

### Share your dreams
When you share your dreams with others, you solidify them in your own mind, making them more real. You also give yourself just enough peer pressure that you won’t back down easily when things get tough and your dream seems out of reach.

### Put a time limit on it
When you put a time limit on achieving your dreams, it makes you work harder to reach your goals and gives you something concrete to aim for. Basically it helps you do all of the above more effectively. Your time limit should ideally be long enough to give you a realistic chance, but not so long that you can coast and keep putting the important things off.

We all deserve to live the life of our dreams, so instead of just thinking about them, get out there and make them happen. You’ll be happier, healthier and more rounded as a human being if you do.
