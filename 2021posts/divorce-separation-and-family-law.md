### One of the most difficult family law issues that can arise is when parents decide to divorce. It's not an easy decision for any family and it can be emotionally draining. 

When you have children together, decisions about parenting plans, child support and other [family law matters](/) will need to be made in order to ensure a healthy transition for everyone involved. This article will discuss important things you should know before filing for divorce so that your [free family law consultation](https://fullersfamilylaw.com/contact/consultation){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} goes as smoothly as possible.

Matters can get complicated and emotional quickly, so it's important to plan ahead. Sit down with your spouse when you're feeling calm and discuss the best way for things to go forward like parenting plans if you have children together or child support payments if necessary. It may not seem like these types of conversations are too difficult at first, but as time goes on they can become a lot more heated which is why planning is essential.

### Post divorce
Family law issues come up after divorce has begun in many cases. This means that people who are still getting used to their new lives post-divorce will be dealing with another life transition all over again - navigating the family court system independently while also handling some other family responsibilities on their own without their ex.

### Financial matters
Divorce can be expensive and time-consuming, which is why it's important to have a lawyer on your side who has experience handling family matters in the court system. Even if you're not going through a divorce yet, there are many other family law issues that arise outside of divorce like child custody or guardianship disagreements between parents; parenting disputes (too much parental interference vs too little); determining where children go to school; how often they visit their grandparents' home country without travelling with them back and forth each year; negotiating when one parent will move away for work after splitting from a spouse.
If divorce proceedings are ongoing, it may come up that one spouse is requesting spousal support. Spousal support payments will need to be negotiated based on factors like income levels, what kind of work each person does and their respective lifestyle needs post-divorce.

### Parenting plans
Family law can also involve parenting plans which include a schedule that spells out how often parents will spend time with their kids or decisions about who they live with full time, if one parent has more than 50% custody. If you have questions about this type of arrangement then consult an experienced family lawyer because the court system does not provide these services on its own.

### Mediation
If divorce proceedings are ongoing, there may come a point when mediation becomes necessary. Mediation is when two parties work together (separately) to negotiate terms related to parenting arrangements, child support, access to family property or other family law matters. It's a good idea not to start negotiations before consulting an experienced family lawyer who can provide legal advice and guidance on the best way forward.
Family law is about family and the wellbeing of children, so it's always important to consider what would be best for your family in any given situation.
