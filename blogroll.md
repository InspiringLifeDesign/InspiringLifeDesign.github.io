## Financial Independence/Early Retirement Sites
Below is a list of the many Financial Independence, Retire Early (F.I.R.E.) blogs which I have come across and enjoy reading. I hope you enjoy following the journeys to financial freedom as much as I do!

### UK Sites
- [**Quietly Saving**](http://quietlysaving.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - written by 40-something "weenie", charting her journey to FIRE before 60
- [**Saving Ninja**](https://thesavingninja.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - is a relatively new FIRE blogger, tracking their progress to FIRE with monthly savings reports. Also instigated the recent [Thought Experiments](/tag/thought-experiments.html) series


### Great Resource Sites
- [**Monevator**](http://monevator.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - if I ever need to make an investing decision, Monevator is the first place I go. It's great for working out which investment products would suit you
