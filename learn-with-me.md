# Learn With Me

### Mentoring & Training
I offer one-to-one mentoring for anyone interested in getting started with **online book publishing** or **blogging**. 

I also offer training and mentoring in IT agile project management, particularly for anyone looking to learn about becoming a **Scrum Master**.

All mentoring and training is carried out online using video conferencing software. I offer a **free 30 minute** initial consultation to understand your needs where we can decide whether I am the right person to help you.

My mentoring and training rates start at Â£50 per hour.

[**Email me** for more information](mailto:hello@inspiringlifedesign.com).

### #PublishIn8 Program
As well as one-to-one mentoring I also run an 8 week program several times throughout the year as an introduction to online book publishing. In this program we cover all the basics needed to be able to publish a book on Amazon Kindle.

If you are interested in being on the waiting list for future #PublishIn8 programs you can [**sign up here**](/signup/publishin8).
