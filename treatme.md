# Treat Me

Inspiring Life Design and my other income hustles such as online book publishing and survey sites are my only sources of income.

If you enjoy my site or any of my social media channels and would like to show your appreciation then there are a couple of ways to do this (see below). 

Please do not feel obliged to make a contribution - I am incredibly grateful simply for you visiting my site and chatting to me in the comments.

If you do choose to make a contribution then I offer you my sincere thanks, as every little helps!

### Amazon Wishlist
I also have a wishlist at Amazon (pretty much everything on this list will help me advance the website or YouTube channel):
