### For better or worse, money plays a major part in our lives. It dictates the way we think and live, causing us joy and stress in almost equal measure. Have a good money mindset, and you will operate wisely. Have a bad money mindset, and you will face difficulties in life.

***

### If you're always thinking “I will never have enough money”
What are you doing to turn things around? You will never have enough money if you don’t make **changes** in your life. Perhaps you should be saving more, putting your money into investments, or finding ways to earn extra money. For example, I've already [written about blogging](http://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/write-about-what-you-love.html){:target="_blank"} as one way to increase your earnings, or why not try [online publishing](http://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/5-money-making-reasons-to-publish-books.html){:target="_blank"}?  Not all of us benefit from a high-paying salary, but it’s the way we *manage* the money that we **do** have and it’s the way we take steps to improve our prospects that matters. Even if becoming mega rich feels out of your grasp right now, you can always become *richer*.

### If you're always thinking “I don’t know how to manage my money”
Then stop fretting. You don’t need to be a financial whiz to get on top of your finances. Take time to learn the basics of personal finance, try using a budgeting site such as [www.thebalance.com](https://www.thebalance.com/){:target="_blank"}, and speak to people who may be able to help you (an advisor at your bank, for example). Money management doesn’t come naturally to all of us, but consider taking these steps and you'll begin to realise that it's not as difficult as you think.

### If you're always thinking “I will never afford the things I want”
Try thinking practically. What is it that you *do* want? By **putting money into a savings account** each month, you will build up a steady amount to help you purchase the things you are craving. By **finding ways to earn more**, you will also have extra cash to play around with. And for larger items that it would take a long time to save up for (such as car purchases) you may want to consider taking out a loan as long as it is within your budget to easily make the repayments. When I was younger I took out a loan to buy my Mazda MX5 car because it was the only way I could find the money to make the purchase. I bought a 2nd hand car and carefully researched the best loan rates, making sure the repayments were within an affordable range for me. Using sites to compare rates such as [https://www.auto.loan/](https://www.auto.loan/){:target="_blank"} (or a UK equivalent site) to find a deal you can afford will help with the process. When thinking about the things you want to buy, if you make sensible financial decisions you will surprise yourself at how many of them are within your reach.

### If you're always thinking “live for today and screw tomorrow”
Then I'm sorry to break it to you, but you're going to find yourself in difficulties at some point. I'm not saying that you should never "seize the day" and live in the moment, but when it comes to finances if you want to get ahead you need to **think about the future** and do some financial planning. The younger you can do this the more it will benefit you. Don't be that person who always depletes their paycheck weeks before the next payday! And most importantly, don't get into debt without thinking about the consequences. If you find yourself already in debt and feeling overwhelmed by it, consider seeing a debt advisor who can help you consolidate and come up with a repayment plan. It's never worth letting debt get you down or take over your life, take control of it instead!

Start making small changes first and build up from there. Try regularly setting some money aside into savings (start with building an emergency fund, then move onto other savings), create a budget that works for you, and prioritise only the things that you most want to buy so that you always stay within your means. 

Live a little today by all means, but don't let it be at the detriment of your happiness in the future!


*Do you relate to any of the above? If so, try and turn things around. Form a positive relationship with money, rather than having negative attitudes that won’t help you in the long run. You will be better off, both mentally and financially if you do.*
