### As much as we’d all love for life to go swimmingly, it very rarely does. 

You can never really make a plan and just expect it to all work out. Because things happen and things change and things get in the way. We lose people, our hearts get broken, illness happens, and it can all feel catastrophic at the time. And it probably always will. But we learn to deal with things that life throws at us. When we’re given lemons, we HAVE to learn to make lemonade. Because there is no alternative. You cannot just crawl into a hole or let things fall apart - especially if you have a family to consider and there are others depending on you. So, if you feel as if you’ve just been dealt a huge basket of lemons, here’s how to make lemonade...

 
### Starting To Side Hustle
One thing that might be appropriate for you right now, is learning how to side hustle. Because if you’re not making enough money, or if you’ve lost your job, or you’re struggling to pay your bills, doing something proactive will make you feel better. Sure, you’ve got a ton of lemons on your lap right now, but girl - pick them up and make lemonade. Turn to your evenings or the early morning and do an extra bit of work on something that can [earn you some money on the side](/posts/first-six-money-makers.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and potentially earn you a ton in the future.

### Preparing For The Worst
It’s always a trying time when someone close to you is ill and you’re afraid of losing them. But should the worst happen, you'll want to make sure that you can give your loved one the best possible send-off to honour their life. You cannot fall apart at a time like this. Taking a look at local [funeral homes](https://heartofenglandfuneralcare.co.uk/funeral/funeral-homes/daventry/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} online, is a good starting point to find a compassionate and considerate undertaker, who will make sure that your family's wishes are cared for. You may find some small comfort at such a difficult time, by taking the opportunity to celebrate their life through a well thought-out service and funeral arrangements.

### Covering Your Bases
Whatever lemons have been flung at you, there's always the opportunity to look ahead and plan for the future. You may want to consider putting some insurance in place. Because, you never know what is coming your way. From protecting your home to your health, your valuables and your livelihood, when you have insurance in place, you’ll have peace of mind for your future.

### Focusing On The Basics
If you feel as if you’ve been dealt lemons in terms of your health or your body or your mind, this may be a time to start working harder on yourself. Focus on [becoming a healthier you](https://www.realbuzz.com/articles-interests/health/article/health-commandments-must-do-rules-for-a-better-you/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. When you improve your body and your fitness and you’re feeling good instead of feeling down, then you’ve really found the recipe to make your own amazing lemonade.

### Finding Your Own Happiness
Finally, you need to be okay with finding your path back to happiness, in your own way. Life may give you lemons and you may go through a hard time or you may be thrown a curve ball, but you CAN and you WILL come out of it. More often than not, you just need to decide **what happiness looks like to you** and what you can do to **create a life that you absolutely love**. 

When you do this, you’ll be thankful for those lemons, because they made you stronger and more resilient, and you can sit back to enjoy your delicious lemonade knowing that you got through this.
