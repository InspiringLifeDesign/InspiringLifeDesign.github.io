### Sometimes we can find ourselves in difficult situations and our finances can be one of those times. 

We try our best, but the rising costs of food, fuel, and the cost of living in general can leave us in a bit of a mess, particularly if the rise of inflation is not reflected in our wage packets or [income](http://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/july-2018-income-report.html){:target="_blank"}. It can be quite a difficult time as well, financial problems can often be the biggest causes of arguments between couples and can also be a leading cause of depression and anxiety. But, you can improve your situation with some careful planning and changes. I wanted to share with you some of the ways you could do it.

### Look at your current outgoings
One of the first things to do is to look at your current outgoings and incomings and see what the issue is. Your bank statements are a good place to start. Carefully work through everything, looking at whether there are any outgoings you can eliminate. You may find rogue direct debits you had forgotten to cancel. Once you have reduced your outgoings to just those that **must** be paid, look at ways of reducing them, perhaps changing provider for things like energy or insurance products. Sometimes loyalty doesnâ€™t pay and you may get a cheaper deal elsewhere.

### Is debt causing you a big problem?
One of the biggest problems that people face is debt, and this can be taking up a huge chunk of your money each month. It is the one thing that we have to pay back, but it is also the one thing that could be costing you the most in terms of interest and mounting charges. It can often feel like a black hole that will never end, but taking action can help you to get through it. If you are struggling to pay debt off, then things like [Freedom Debt Relief](https://debtconsolidation.co/freedom-debt-relief-reviews/){:target="_blank"} programs could work in your favour. Another option would be to focus on the debt that is costing you the most, and make it your mission to pay it off with any extra income you have - prioritising your repayments on the most costly of your debt.

### Make changes to your habits to save money
You could also make changes to the way you live and the habits you have when it comes to spending. Simple things like collecting coupons and using them in stores, looking out for discount codes and using cashback sites when shopping online. You could also do things like [meal planning](https://www.thekitchn.com/10-tips-for-better-weekly-meal-planning-reader-intelligence-report-177252){:target="_blank"}, and writing shopping lists to ensure that you only buy what you need. This will help you to reduce waste and also keep your spending to a minimum.

### Could You Do Anything To Boost Your Income?
Finally, there may be ways that you can boost your income in your spare time, that can help towards overdue bills or debt repayments, or even just to fill up the savings account. Selling unwanted things on websites like eBay could be a great way to boost your finances. You could also use your spare time to take advantage of online side hustles such as filling out online surveys or website testing. Even things like mystery shopping can be quite lucrative from time to time. 

I hope that these tips help you to improve your current financial situation.
