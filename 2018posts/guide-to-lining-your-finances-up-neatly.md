### Financial management is a very important life skill to learn. There’s more to organising your money than earning a good income. You need to know how to spend and save your earnings appropriately. 

It’s never too early or too late to start making improvements to the way in which you use your savings. You just need to adopt a structured plan when it comes to your personal finances. This guide to lining your money up neatly might just provide you with the advice you need.

### Sort out your monthly expenditures
The first step to taking better care of your money is to sort out your monthly expenditures. You need to make a structured budget if you want to line your finances up neatly. [And that starts with calculating your expenses](/posts/freedom-plan-part-1.html){:target="_blank"}. In fact, it helps to log your expenses on a regular basis to account for any changes that might take place in your spending habits from month to month. But you should figure out how much you need to spend on the basic things you need in life. Once you know that, you’ll know how much excess income you have on a monthly basis. And if you don’t think you have enough disposable income then you should look for ways to reduce your spending. You could use coupons when shopping and use comparison sites to weigh up phone or internet providers. [You need to set yourself financial goals](https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/slideshows/50-ways-to-improve-your-finances-in-2015?slide=2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to keep your spending limited.

### Get a better credit rating
Another way in which you could improve your finances is to get a better credit rating. You might want to avoid debt if you’re trying to organise and protect your personal finances, but not all debt is bad. Consider the debt you take on when you get a mortgage to purchase a house for example. Obviously, you shouldn’t borrow any amount of money that you can’t afford to pay back, but you also shouldn’t rule loans out completely. If you carefully consider your options, a loan may help you to achieve a big goal such as a house or vehicle purchase that you might not otherwise be able to afford. If you don’t have a credit history then you might struggle to get loans for big purchases such as these. And that could be worse for your finances in the long-run. Sometimes, it’s smarter to pay for things gradually, and lenders can help you with that.

Make sure you repay debts on time to improve your credit rating. You’ve probably borrowed money in the past for things such as student loans, so don’t put off making those repayments. You should also think about the credit cards you use because certain banks offer better deals than others. And you also need to make sure that you use a card which is well-suited to your financial needs. If you’re asking yourself “[what is a good credit card APR](https://best.creditcard/what-is-a-good-apr-on-a-credit-card/){:target="_blank"}?” then you definitely need to do some research on the topic. It’s important that you choose a card with a good interest rate so as to ensure that you’re using your money wisely. Personally I would recommend only using a credit card if it offers you some advantage such as an interest free period, or cashback on your purchases. Always pay off your balance in full every month to ensure that you don't get stung for high interest rates that most credit cards operate with. Building up credit is important, but you need to do so in the most sensible manner possible.

### Start saving regularly.
Of course, one of the smartest ways to line your finances up neatly is to start saving your earnings on a regular basis. You should [automatically set aside some of your income](https://www.wikihow.com/Adopt-Habits-to-Improve-Your-Personal-Finances){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} so that you’re financially prepared for the future. If you arrange a standing order to transfer a set amount of your monthly earnings to your savings account (on your payday, ideally) then you’ll start to quickly build up a moderate amount of savings for the future.
