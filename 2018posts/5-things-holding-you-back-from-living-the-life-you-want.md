### If you're unhappy with your current life, chances are that you will need to change your mindset before you can make significant progress.

***

Whether you would like to improve your money situation or manage your time better, there are certain ways you can improve your attitude towards work and life. Below you will find a list of things to check that might be holding you back from living the life you want to.

### 1. No Financial Plan
Without setting **clear financial targets** you will not achieve your goals. It is important that you check your monthly budget and make changes so you can make your money work for you and not the other way around. You might set a target of earning an extra £200 a month by side hustles, or reduce your expenses by £300 every quarter. Once you know what you want to achieve, you can make a plan. To make sure that you succeed, you should check your credit file and understand the process of [credit inquiry removal](https://repair.credit/how-to-remove-negative-items-from-your-credit-report/){:target="_blank"} thus improving your rating should you need to secure finance for your business endeavours.  

### 2. Lack of Motivation 
We all struggle with motivation from time to time. Whether it is the weather or the lack of rewards, making you less keen on improving your life, it might be time to focus on the inside. There are several great [free hypnosis sessions](http://www.freehypnosissessions.com/){:target=_blank"} available on the internet that will help you discover why you lack motivation. Sometimes lack of motivation is because you have lost (or haven't built up) momentum. **Start doing something small** to get you moving in the right direction, and build up to larger things over time - you'll be feeling motivated in no time at all!

### 3. Family Issues 
If your personal life is not in order, and you have to deal with conflict and arguments all the time, you're less likely to have the energy to change your life. You will be constantly dealing with emergencies and trying to react to situations instead of changing them. Try to make the right decision about your relationships and move on if necessary to have more energy to improve your life. Talk to your close family members and seek their support, it's amazing how **a simple conversation** and laying your cards on the table **can make a huge difference**.

### 4. Living In the Past 
Many of us are affected by past experiences. Just because you didn’t succeed in your first profession, business, or relationship, it doesn’t mean that you will never do. You have to **learn to let go** of negative experiences and [learn from your mistakes](http://scottberkun.com/essays/44-how-to-learn-from-your-mistakes/){:target="_blank"} before you take a step forward. Instead of constantly thinking about what didn’t work out in the past, get creative and **start learning new skills** and try something different this time.

### 5. Fear of Failure

You might have been staying in your job for too long, because you didn’t believe that you could do anything else, or for fear you might not succeed in setting up your own business. It is time to let go of fear and [create a freedom plan](http://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/freedom-plan-part-2.html){:target="_blank"} for the future. **If you never try you will never succeed**, and failure is not the end of the world. 

If you would like to improve your life, you will have to start by **changing your attitude** and your thinking. Say goodbye to fear and let go of the past so you can focus on building a **better and brighter future**.
