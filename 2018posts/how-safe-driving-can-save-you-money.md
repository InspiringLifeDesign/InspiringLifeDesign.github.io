### Though many people endeavour to drive safely to avoid the risk of accidents, not many people realise that there is also a financial implication to safer driving too. The better driver you are, the less it will cost you to go on the roads. 

Most insurers will look at your driving history to establish the right price for you. This means that they will see whether you have made any claims, caused any accidents or if you have any tickets. The cleaner your record is, the lower the cost will be (and [the more you can save](/posts/save-one-thousand-pounds.html){:target="_blank"}).

While saving lives should always be your top priority, here are a few tips to help you cool your speed and improve your technique to bring down your insurance costs, avoid getting tickets and enjoy driving that little bit more. 

### Take Care Of Your Blind Spot
The blind spot is easy to forget - especially if you are a seasoned driver - but this is exactly why you must make a conscious effort to check it. Cars suddenly pulling out or changing lanes without checking their blind spots are some of the biggest causes of motorcycle accidents on the road according to this [motorcycle accident lawyer](https://www.daveabels.com/motorcycle-accidents.html){:target="_blank"} and yet they are also easy to avoid. 

Make a point of checking your blind spot before you make any manoeuvre. Remember: <i>mirror, signal, manoeuvre</i> should be your mantra in the car. 

### Watch Your Speed
Speeding is all too easy when you are in a rush and desperate to reach your destination. But speeding is also a bad habit that many drivers accidentally fall into because they feel safe driving above the limit and donâ€™t consciously reduce their speed. 

While you might feel fine driving above the limit, this is still illegal. Make a greater effort to look at the speed limit signs as they come up and check your speedometer to ensure you are well within the limit. Driving at the limit is fine too, but it is a lot easier to slip over by accident. 

Some insurers may also offer a [black box](https://www.moneysupermarket.com/car-insurance/how-does-black-box-insurance-work/){:target="_blank"} to monitor your driving skills and - hopefully - give you reductions based on good driving the following year. Sticking to speed limits and driving sensibly is the best way to make the most of this deal. 

### Cool Your Temper
[Road rage is a big issue in the UK](https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/cars/811471/Road-rage-UK-driving-motorist-car-research){:target="_blank"} and lots of people are victims to angry drivers. Of course, with the almost constant roadworks and many towns built way before cars were even thought of, it is very easy to become frustrated behind the wheel. 

But instead of getting riled, try to keep calm and avoid making any gestures or shouting at other drivers. Yes, that car just did a ridiculous 11 point turn that held up the whole road but you are a zen master, singing your favourite song and trying not to grimace. However tempted you are to pull a similarly crazy manoeuvre to get past, resist. Your insurance premium will thank you for it later.
