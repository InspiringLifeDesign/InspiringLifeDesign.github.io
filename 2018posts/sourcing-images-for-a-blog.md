### Being a content creator is never a simple job, especially as laws get stricter and user expectations get higher. 

You can spend weeks writing a single piece, working it into something which you consider near perfect, and still have people struggle to engage with it. Of course, this could be down to loads of different factors. You may have posted it at the wrong time or failed to market it well enough, but the most common examples of people ignoring blogs are down to the images which have been used. To help you to solve this issue with your own blog, this post will be exploring the three greatest options you have for it.

### Stock Photos
Around the web, there are loads of websites which dedicate themselves to giving away free stock photos. Pexels, Unsplash, and [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/){:target="_blank"} are great examples, and there are plenty more to choose from, giving you loads of options if you want to get your photos for free. As their only major downside, a lot of these photos will have been used before. Other blogs will have already gotten to them, and this can make it hard to find something unique. If you’re willing to pay, options like Adobe Stock and Shutterstock are filled with affordable options which won’t be found in other places.

### Private Pictures
Along with images for sale and those available for free, there will be plenty of photos around the web which have the potential to be sold. Tools like Deviantart make it possible to get in touch with artists very easily. Of course, you will have to pay for other people’s work when you want to use it like this, but this could still be cheaper than buying stock photos, while also [giving you more freedom](http://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/write-about-what-you-love.html){:target="_blank"} to choose something you like. It’s never worth stealing images like this, even if you’re not very likely to get caught. Instead, you should always work hard to get permission.

### Something Of Your Own
With the power of modern smartphones, you don’t need a fancy DSLR or mirrorless camera to start taking great photos. As long as you are able to get the composition right, taking excellent photos will only take a little bit of practice, and you will be able to start filling your blog in no time at all. Of course, you may need some software to help you out. Photoshop really is easier to learn with a real life teacher. [Training Connection](https://www.trainingconnection.com/photoshop-training.php){:target="_blank"} provide a supportive learning environment which could provide better results than learning on your own. Along with this, you could think about watching some YouTube videos which teach you how to use your camera.

Hopefully, this post will inspire you to start working harder on the content which you prepare for your blog. In a world of instant gratification, people simply don’t have time for posts which look like ones they’ve seen before, and you have to consider this when working on your own. Of course, there are loads of tools out there to help you, and this shouldn’t be too hard to achieve.
