# Light Your Home The Right Way
*This post may contain affiliate links*

It might not seem like such an important factor when [designing your home](https://www.lionshome.co.uk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, but good lighting truly is everything and can make or break a room. The lighting you choose will affect the ambiance and mood of a space, get it right and the entire look of your home will improve.

Here are a few tips for creating a well-lit home…

### Ceiling height
The height of your ceilings is very important when selecting lighting for your home, especially when it comes to hanging light fixtures. Some lights will come with adjustable cables or rods, but many others won’t so don’t get stuck with a light that hangs too low or too high for your ceilings.

As a general rule, the bottom of a light should hang approx 12 - 20 inches below a standard 8ft ceiling. For each additional foot of ceiling height, add around 3 inches. When hanging a light over a table or a kitchen island, 28 - 34 inches is the recommended distance from the bottom of the light to the top of the table or island. However, the size of the light also makes a difference so bare that in mind as well.

### Lighting Preferences
Consider what your lighting preferences are during the initial design phase of your renovation or DIY make over. Planning ahead should prevent any mistakes or design flaws from occurring later on. 

If you’re planning on adding new pendant lighting but don’t want to deal with the expense or hassle of changing your home’s electrical setup, cord swags can be a stylish solution. Swag them loosely over a bar or a hook, or secure the cord tight to the ceiling for an industrial look. Incase you’re struggling to find the perfect light, [Lionshome](https://www.lionshome.co.uk/furniture-lights/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} has a great selection of lights for you to choose from. 

### Experiment with your lighting
Don’t limit your lighting to just down lights. Depending on the location, why not consider wall sconces or uplighting to create a softer ambiance and avoid any potentially harsh lighting that can cast ominous shadows. Table lamps are great for creating a softer, more subtle lighting effect.

You could even consider using light as a piece of art. Perhaps you have a large wall, screaming out for some artwork, why not fill the space with a beautiful piece of lighting art to fill the space but to also create a real feature and light up the area at the same time.

### Lighting Fixtures
The light fixture should not be your only consideration — the type of lightbulb is equally important. Halogen, compact fluorescent and LED bulbs come in a range of warm or cool hues. Much like the colour of your walls, the type of glow you want is mostly a personal decision.

If your walls are covered in cooler tones, you might want to warm them up with a lightbulb that casts a warm glow. Conversely, you may want a cooler glow to brighten up a darker space.

### Stair lights
Adding some form of lighting to your stairs is not only beneficial since it can be hazardous negotiating stairs in the dark, but you could also make a feature of them by beautifully lighting them up. Putting the lights underneath the steps or at the sides can create amazing lighting affects and cast wonderful shadows in the enclosed stairwell. 

### Base lighting
When thinking about your lighting, don’t stop at wall or ceiling lights, why not add some novel lighting. Strip lighting on the underside of base cabinets, especially in the kitchen, is a great way to create a night light that looks fabulous and will transform the look and feel of the space. 

### Add some colour
Lighting doesn’t have to be confined to warm white or white light, you could even add some colour to your lights. By putting a light fixture in a bright hue in an otherwise simple or dark room, can add some fun and interest to the space, really show off your personality.
