### Moving out of a rental home is a delicate process, and it could cost you if you make a misstep. Use this tenant move out checklist as your guide.

Moving out of a rental can be stressful. While moving causes enough stress on its own, you want to make sure you do everything right so you can get your deposit back.There's a general list of things you should do when moving out, and there are likely some things your rental's owner requires, too. While we can't help with your specific owner's requests, we can help with the basics.So here's your ultimate tenant move out checklist. Keep reading to make sure you don't miss anything important!

### 1. Refer to your Rental AgreementFirst things first, you've got to check your rental agreement. That's where you'll find the specifics for your rental property. No matter what list you follow, make sure you check here first.Your rental agreement may list specific things you need to do in order to move out. It should also tell you how to get your deposit back.There's always a chance you'll find out you don't have to do as much as you thought, too. For all these reasons, make sure you don't forget to check your agreement.### 2. Gather all DocumentsAs you prepare to move, gather all documents that have to do with your lease. This may include your rental agreement, a Gas Safety Certificate, contracts with utility and service providers, and a move-in inventory report.If you've kept receipts (and you should have) gather all of those. These should include receipts for utilities, rental payments, and any repairs, improvements, etc. that were made during your rental period.### 3. Let the Landlord KnowYou'll need to let your landlord know you plan to move. Give them plenty of notice so they have time to find a new renter if they wish. That doesn't mean they have to find a new renter in order for you to move out, though.Your rental agreement will likely give you a time range requirement. For example, it may state that move out notice must be given 30 days prior to your move out date. Make sure you follow the specific guidelines that are found in your agreement.### 4. Lease RequirementsMake sure you've fulfilled your lease requirements. Upon signing your lease, you agreed to rent the property for a designated amount of time. You could face penalties if you haven't met this requirement, so make sure you have.### 5. Cancel UtilitiesAll utility providers need to know you're moving. Contact them to let them know.It's a good idea to contact your landlord in regards to utilities. They may not want services completely stopped. Make the proper arrangements so you don't keep paying after you've moved.### 6. Setup a Forwarding AddressWhen you move, make sure you set up a [forwarding address](https://www.royalmail.com/personal/receiving-mail/redirection){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. This will redirect your mail to the right place, even if it's addressed to the location you're leaving.### 7. Update Your InfoOnce you're ready to move, update your contact info in all important places. You may be surprised how many places need this information updated.
It's a good idea to make a list so you don't forget anything important. Here are some places and people for you to consider:

- Doctors, dentists, and hospitals regularly used- Insurance companies- Financial institutions- [HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/tell-hmrc-change-of-details){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}- [DVLA](https://www.gov.uk/tell-dvla-changed-address){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}- Work- Friends and family- Online retailers frequented by you- Subscriptions- Church- SchoolAnyone you receive a bill from, such as phone service provider, should receive notice of the change as well. Update anyone who sends you payments, too.### 8. Pay all BillsMake sure you've paid all your bills in full. If you haven't, your landlord could subtract money from your deposit in order to pay them. Check and double check that everything's been taken care of.### 9. Set up an InspectionYour landlord will likely require a move-out inspection. A few days before moving out, schedule the inspection with them. If you want or need to be present for the inspection, make sure it's set up for a time when you can be there.
Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself if your landlord tries to hold you responsible for damage that was present when you moved in.### 10. Leave the Place CleanYour rental agreement probably states some specific cleaning you need to perform when you move out. If it doesn't, clean the place anyway. Aim to leave the property looking better than when you found it.
Sweep, vacuum, and clean carpets and flooring. Wipe down windows, floorboards, and appliances. Make sure each room is clean, including drawers, cabinets, closets, and other nooks. Don't leave any items in the home, including food and garbage. Make sure you've removed everything, whether you intend to keep it or not.
If batteries need to be replaced in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, that's your job. You're also responsible for replacing burned out light bulbs.
If there are any marks left on floors or walls, clean them off. Dust all areas that may have dust or cobwebs. And don't forget to clean up the outside space too!
Make sure you leave yourself plenty of time to clean. You may be surprised just how long it takes!
