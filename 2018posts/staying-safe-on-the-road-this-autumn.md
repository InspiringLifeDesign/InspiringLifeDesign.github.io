# Staying Safe On The Road This Autumn
*This post may contain affiliate links*

Well, [summer](/posts/how-to-plan-for-best-disneyland-paris-trip-ever.html){:target="_blank"} has more or less left us behind now, even though we still technically have some time left before Autumn arrives. Still, we’re all beginning to look forward to the season of scarves, hot chocolates, and cosy nights in. However, as much as we’d like to hole up indoors until spring has returned, life must go on. We have to go outside and carry on with business as usual. For the most part, this is fine, but when the weather is at it's worst, it can be the last thing that we feel like doing. It’s not just our hands that are affected by the cold weather: our commute is too. Below, we take a look at a few ways you can ensure you’re kept safe out there.

### Changing Weather
When the weather is a bit more grim than the bright and clear days of summer, we all need to take a little more care on the roads. There are plenty of potential dangers out there! While the UK might not get battered by the elements in the same way other countries around the world do, we get our fair share of bad weather, what with the rain, floods, icy conditions and snow. If you wake up with the rain lashing down, and the wind is fierce, pay a little bit more attention to your driving. 

### Other Transport 
It’s bad enough to be in a car when the weather is terrible, but if you’re on a bicycle or motorbike, then it’s even worse. You’ll be more susceptible to the conditions of the road if they’re slippy. On top of that you need to pay special attention to the cars on the road. When visibility is reduced, car drivers can sometimes fail to see those streamlined bikes and motorbikes whooshing past them. Take precautions to make sure that you stand out, and that your visibility is increased. Should the worst happen and you're involved in an accident, you may want to consider working with a person who specialises in your type of accident if making a claim, such as a [motorcycle accident lawyer](https://www.gbw.law/personal-injury/motorcycle-accident/){:target="_blank"}. You should also slow things down when you’re riding, especially when there’s high winds or heavy rain.

### Dark Mornings
As the nights draw in, so the mornings get darker. Driving in the dark does make driving more complicated. Obviously it’s harder to see what’s up ahead when everything is slightly dark. But there’s also the matter of your alertness. During the summer, you wake up with energy, raring to go. In autumn and winter, it can take a little longer for your mind to wake up, so make sure that you’re fully awake before getting in the car. A cold shower, early morning run, and energetic breakfast should do the trick.

### Sun Glare 
The soft light of autumn can be a dream, but it can be a nightmare to drive through. Because of the [position of the sun](http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/astro/newcomb/II.3.html){:target="_blank"}, you may often find that the sunlight is beaming right into your eyes, as opposed to summer when the sun is overhead. Make sure you’re keeping your windscreen clean and clear, and always have a pair of sunglasses handy too just in case.
