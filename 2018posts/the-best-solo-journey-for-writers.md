### When contributing to any form of personal artistic effort, you need to [**explore the world**](https://www.travellikeachieff.com/40-travel-hacks-that-will-make-your-next-trip-much-easier/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

A painter must witness the best masterpieces and pay respect to the great artists of his craft. A musician must get past their genre comfort zone and listen to music they may not be altogether familiar with to see just how versatile their instrument can be. A writer must travel in order to fill themselves with experience, to meet people and see how cultures differ. 

This last point is very important. It’s hard to find great writers who haven’t at least had some interesting or strange life experience. For that reason, heading out and forging your own memories can be the best place to start if you hope to become a famous new novelist. 

With this simple solo journey guide for writers, you will absolutely be on your way there:

### Isolation vs. Action
There’s something extremely reflective about [writing](https://www.nownovel.com/blog/writing-tips-from-authors-nobel/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. This is why many writers like to retire to their own quarters, or their own offices to spend hours deliberating, honing and imagining. This is the bread and butter of any writer’s life, the ability to take that which they’ve experienced and thought, and to sit in relative silence going over the fundamentals of what they think, and exactly how this pours onto the page. Of course, when on vacation, you will still need this reflective time. It’s why finding a beautiful [cottage to rent](http://www.dhcottages.co.uk/holiday-cottages-weymouth/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, or at least finding your own camper van or portable transport is essential. You need alone time.

But be sure to balance this with action. See what’s going on in the local environment. It might be there are plenty of activities, historical tours, museums, and even writers from the location you’ve visited to help you add content to your ideas. Even a long morning walk through the country landscape can be deeply affecting and personal for someone, so be sure to incorporate this into your writing vacation.

### A Travel Itinerary
Writers tend to thrive from routine and schedule. Writer’s block or lethargy is the easiest thing in the world to sink into, so be sure to follow a plan or itinerary to ensure that you stay productive. You might take your meals out in a new place each day, while concentrating on your writing in the morning. You might decide to write in beautiful cafes while watching the flow of life. You might even connect to writers doing the same thing, as you’ll likely recognise the furrowed and inquisitive brow of someone trying to put their thoughts to paper. 

A travel itinerary keeps you focused, active, and helps to create a balance between isolation and action. In this way your travel can support the goals you came to achieve. Then exploring the evocative scenery, perhaps contacting your sources of inspiration, and even keeping a journal for versatile writing experiences will not only be achievable but will inform your day with energy.

With these tips, heading on a solo journey, to further your writing ambition is sure to be useful.
