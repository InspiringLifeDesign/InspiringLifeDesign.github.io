### The ability to drive becomes essential for every young professional at some stage. Ambitious professionals, after all, don’t postpone important business meetings because their trains are delayed.

They certainly don’t turn down business opportunities because there’s no bus service. Instead, they hop in their car and do what they need to do, to climb that ladder.

But, there is an issue here. Even if you fork out all your [emergency fund](https://abudgetingblonde.com/the-why-what-and-how-of-saving-money-for-an-emergency/){:target="_blank"} on driving lessons, car ownership is a monthly addition your budget may not stretch to. Even if you could make it work, you would leave yourself short to save for other things. Or, would you?

[Owning a vehicle is pricey](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/total-cost-owning-car/){:target="_blank"}, there are no two ways around that fact. But, it is possible to own a car and still have spare money to set aside. You may find in the long run, that it's actually a cheaper option than all those expensive train tickets - they add up! At least, it could be if you consider the following...

### Get An Economic Model
It’s no secret that fuel is often the most expensive monthly cost of owning a car. In the US, the average price at the time of writing is [around $2.54 per gallon](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/08/average-us-gas-price-jumps-3-cents-to-2-point-54-for-regular.html){:target="_blank"}. When you consider that some cars take roughly sixteen gallons, that’s a hefty price tag for every refill. Your money-saving efforts here, then, can start before you even sign on the dotted line. When searching for a vehicle, you should consider looking for fuel-efficient options which will travel further for less. The Hyundai Ioniq Blue, for instance, is [the most fuel-efficient car for sale in the U.S.](https://cleantechnica.com/2018/01/07/5-fuel-efficient-cars-sale-usa/){:target="_blank"} right now and manages around 58 miles per gallon. You can bet you’d have money spare if you drove one of these. 

### Drive well
This may seem like a simple point, but it’s incredibly important. Driving well, will help to prevent you needing to make any insurance claims. That, in turn, should see steep insurance rates dropping over time. Driving well can also reduce wear and tear, saving you money on repairs. It also ensures that  should the worst happen, and you're involved in an accident, you can rest easy knowing that you were driving within the rules of the law. Should you need to, you’ll be free to [hire a car accident lawyer](https://www.dolmanlaw.com/hire-car-accident-lawyer/){:target="_blank"} to fight your corner. You may even find that you are entitled to compensation. Careful driving is imperative, not just for the safety of all, but also to protect your bank balance. 

### Get some basic knowledge
If you head to a garage for even basic repairs, there's always the risk of a nasty surprise if some unexpected part needs replacing. General wear and tear means certain things, like your tyres, will need changing from time to time. But it's not essential to spend a fortune on professional assistance for this. With a little research, and a bit of spare time, you could do certain basic repairs yourself. 

With a little ingenuity, up-front-planning and careful driving, keeping a car on the road doesn't need to break the bank. If it helps to motivate you, you could put any money you save straight back into your savings pot.
