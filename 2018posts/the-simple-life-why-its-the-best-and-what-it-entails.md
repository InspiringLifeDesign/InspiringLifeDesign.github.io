### We all live complex lives, there's no way around it. Human beings are complex and by their very nature build a web of complicated relationships and responsibilities around them. 

You may have noticed this in your own life. Complexity can be good, as it provides us with stimulation, novelty and interest. However, it can also be overwhelming, draining, and more than we can handle. Perhaps then, we should consider simplifying our lives, right down to their roots, to give ourselves the best chance at happiness.

And how do we simplify? There are many possibilities. How about focussing attention onto your relationships with family and friends, looking to experience [life's simple pleasures](/posts/autumn-bucket-list.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} with them. Or selecting just a couple of your favourite hobbies so that you can really enjoy quality *you* time. Then of course there's having a big clear out of your things and taking a more minimalist approach: tidy house = tidy mind.

Here follow some suggestions you may want to consider for leading your best simple life:

### Financial Matters
If there's one thing that can make life feel overly complex and difficult, it's finances. When all is well with your finances life feels great, but when money is tight, or worse you have debt hanging over your head, life can feel like a daily grind. There's something to be said for keeping your finances simple. 

This may feel like it's easier said than done, particularly if you're in the trap of struggling from paycheck to paycheck, or even have debts to clear. However never despair, there is **always** a way to make improvement. For example, those who have accumulated several debts should seriously consider using a debt consolidation firm. Do your research to make sure that any consolidation loan would overall offer a lower APR and fees than your current circumstances, but simplifying your repayments into one payment per month can take a massive weight off your mind. Consider visiting [https://debtconsolidation.loans](https://debtconsolidation.loans){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to find out more information on what to look out for when considering debt consolidation, there are a lot of helpful facts they provide.

Aside from getting on top of your debts, it's always a good idea to build up an emergency fund. Then simplify your finances further by creating and following a monthly or weekly budget. Get into the habit of knowing what you are spending and learn to say "no" for the sake of your financial health. Another great way to simplify your finances is to review all your regular monthly outgoings and see if there are anythings you have been paying for which you no longer get value from. Cancel old subscriptions or services which you rarely use. For those regular bills you do still need to pay, set-up direct debit or standing order payments, so that you never have to worry about missing a payment. Surely this is financial simplicity at its finest!

### Passions and Hobbies
For anyone to feel alive and get the most out of life, its important to indulge in at least one [passion or hobby](https://www.quora.com/How-many-hobbies-is-normal){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. The question is, do we have an opportunity to simplify our lives in this area? Some would argue that itâ€™s important to keep our interests simple, so that we are not spread too thinly. This allows us to focus on those hobbies we do pursue with greater vigour and enthusiasm.

One, two or even three hobbies may be considered more than enough for the average person, especially if trying to sustain a job. For those bringing up a family, even one hobby may feel like a luxury. However setting aside a little bit of time for yourself to indulge in your favourite pastime can give you back balance to restore the much needed equilibrium you need. 

At the end of the day, a simple life surely is about a life with less stress, less things on the *to do list*, and more time to enjoy fun things with family or by yourself doing the things you actualy love the most.

If you're finding yourself feeling stressed and always pressed for time, take a step back and look at your life as a whole. Are there any areas you've been spending time on which you don't really need to? Are your perfectionist tendencies causing you to spend too long on the tasks that you do? If you've looked at all of your key responsibilities and find that there's no room to eliminate any more, then you may need to take a look at your hobbies to see if there's anything you can park for now. There's nothing to say you can't come back to it at a later lifestage when life is less hectic.

<br>
Why is a simple life the best? The answer is simple! Less is more. Less things to do, less things to look after = less things to worry about, **less stress**, and ultimately **more happiness**, peace and tranquility.

Look to simplify where you can, and start enjoying living your best life today.
