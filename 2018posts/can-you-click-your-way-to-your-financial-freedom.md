*This post may contain affiliate links*

### If you’ve ever played a simulation game such as the Sims or a flash-player alternative for free,  you’ve probably noticed how easy it can be in the virtual world to get rich. 

You just need to click in the right places. For anybody who is looking for a solution to leave the limitation of the 9 to 5 working life, the idea of clicking your way to financial freedom is appealing. But it doesn’t seem exactly applicable in the real world. After all, this kind of thing only works for the Sims! In truth, while it’s fair to say you can’t like-for-like transfer your virtual life into the real world, there is plenty of room in real life to leverage clicks for your financial benefits. Of course, you will need to master some essential skills to make it happen, but depending on your personality and expertise, there is the right solution out there for you! All you need to do is to start and let the clicks do the rest.

### You know the finance market lingo
If you’re an avid reader of financial magazines and material, you probably know everything about trading and maximising your margin requirements to boost your profits. Beware, however, while there are plenty of accessible and user-friendly online stock markets such as [CMC Markets](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-au/stockbroking/options){:target="_blank"}, it isn’t a safe place if you’re not well read and experienced in the trading sector.  To make your clicks count, you need to pick an intuitive platform that lets you trade from anywhere and manage risks effectively. While it might be tempting to give trading a go, it’s best to leave the finance market to the passionate who understand it. Indeed, a wrong click could cost you all your savings! 

### You’ve got lots of spare time
If you’re in a professional or personal situation where you’ve got easy access to the Internet and plenty of spare time, you can begin to build [extra income through online surveys](http://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/cash-this-week.html){:target="_blank"}. You need to be highly selective if you don’t want to sign up for a site that constantly screens you out on the basis of your age, location, lifestyle, gender, or even study level. Prolific Academic is a survey site that offers an enjoyable experience in the context of academic studies. As you help to improve knowledge, you receive rewards for your participation. Additionally, the screening process doesn’t feel as cliché and discriminatory as other sites. You may not become a millionaire, but you can generate significant cash by the end of the month! 

### How about you let others click for you?
When it comes to measuring the value of a click, there is no need for you to be the source of the click. If you have a popular blog, for instance, you could join an affiliate marketing programme to [monetise your visits](https://www.business.com/articles/how-to-make-a-good-living-off-affiliate-marketing/){:target="_blank"}. At the core of affiliate marketing success, you need to establish a web presence and publish information and engaging content. A talented affiliate can enjoy high revenues throughout the year. It however, requires quality content and effective engagement strategies to make it work. 


Whether you’re a finance wizard or an enthusiastic blogger, there is value in every click you or others make within your area of expertise. Financial freedom is only one click away.
