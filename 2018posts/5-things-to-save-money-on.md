### There may be more ways of saving money than you realise, so it's worth keeping in mind next time you’re feeling a financial pinch.
***

It could be time to start saving money by not spending on unnecessary things. Here are my 5 things that you can **easily save money on**, by spending no more than you really need to:

### 1. Hiring Tradespeople

Hiring the right tradespeople can be tricky, but you’ll save a lot of money if you compare the options on a **comparison site**. Comparison sites for traders are one of those things that have only really existed in the last few years, so don’t forget to use them. Rather than heading to the first tradesperson you find listed, compare rates and reviews online to find the best and cheapest option possible.

### 2. Getting and Staying Healthy
You don’t need to spend a fortune to get healthy and stay fit. It’s one of those things that anyone can do if they set their mind to it. At the end of the day, **staying healthy is 100% your responsibility**, no-one else can do it for you, and you may as well do it without putting your financial health at risk. Consider pounding the pavement rather than paying for an expensive [gym](https://www.bustle.com/articles/147487-13-reasons-you-should-cancel-your-gym-membership-right-now){:target="_blank"} membership that you may hardly ever use. Also try to cook from scratch, which is much better for you because you know exactly what is going into your meals - and the bonus is that it will save you money on takeaways and convenience food.

### 3. Going Out With Friends
Everyone wants to spend quality time with their friends and family and no one is suggesting that you shouldn't do that. But do you really need to *go out* to do that? Bars, restaurants and other entertainment venues know how to charge, and spending so much of your money on these really adds up. Why not do things together at home such as games nights, film nights or dinner parties, or **pick things to do that are free**? Cutting back your spending on going out is one of the quickest ways to save money.

### 4. Car Maintenance
Your car can often seem like an endless money pit, sucking up your hard earned cash and leaving you with not very much left. But looking after your car can be cheaper, especially if you make use of services like [Vauxhall Service Club](https://www.drivevauxhall.co.uk/about-us/vauxhall-service-club/){:target="_blank"}. It’ll make the task of maintaining your car so much easier than it might otherwise be for you and you’ll be sure to get the right support. Of course if you know a bit about cars there are always things that you can do yourself to keep costs down, if you have the time to spend on it.

### 5. Anything You Buy Online
It’s so easy to save money on the things that you buy online, but many people still don’t realise it. On top of the price comparison websites that I’ve already mentioned, it's always worth searching for **discount codes** which are available for pretty much anything. Always do a search and check discount websites before you complete your online purchases. Otherwise, you’ll be missing out on some great [discounts](https://lifehacker.com/top-10-tricks-to-get-discounts-on-almost-anything-1227564502){:target="_blank"}.

Saving money doesn’t have to be tricky and complicated. If you want to get started with saving money, these basics will get you set off on the right path. Each of the 5 ideas discussed is easy to implement, and you will start saving so much more if you start making use of them in your life right now.
