*This post may contain affiliate links*

### You've been running your own blog for several years now; it started as a passion for you, but now you are ready to take it to the next level and start your own business. 

Blogging is definitely a well-respected business these days. It's another example of a way to get [extra cash](/posts/cash-this-week.html){:target="_blank"} in your pocket on a monthly basis. So you should consider creating a solid action plan, in order to finally launch your blog as a fully-fledged business. The following ideas will help you to professionalise your blogging business from the outset, from refining your niche to designing excellent creative content. Start the process today and you will be able to start making money sooner than you think.

### Become Business Minded
In order to transform your blog into a business, you really need to think about having your own list of email subscribers. These people will be your avid fans. With your list you can share your wisdom, earn revenue from affiliate marketing and sell your products. 

Once you decide to have your own email list, it will be necessary to give your address to your email list provider. This is a legal requirement. This means it's time to get yourself a **professional business address** - even if you work from home. 

Having an official business address to direct your mail to will make you look more professional and importantly protect the privacy of your personal address. Many bloggers and small business owners have happily stated, “[I used this company for my UK address](https://yourvirtualofficelondon.co.uk/how-to-get-a-uk-address-for-your-expat-mail-forwarding-needs/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. There are many options for securing a business address in the country of your choice, by paying for a PO Box, or actual business address. Without having to actually pay to rent a space, you can enjoy a business address where the virtual office will forward, or scan and email your mail to you. I use one of these services and am really happy with it. It means that I can use my business address for my email list and for my registration with the ICO (who you must be registered with under the new GDPR legislation), without having my home address available to all.

### Know Your Niche
Your blogging business simply won’t succeed if you don’t have a clear niche topic to base your brand on. If you’re interested in the general subject of fashion, then you need to dig deeper and think about a more focused idea that will appear to a niche audience. Believe it or not, you have a bigger chance of success if you choose an area which appeals to a very specific (and often small) group of people. You could focus on petite fashion, shoes or even accessories. Pick a broad idea and then make it laser focused to heighten its overall appeal.

### Work Hard To Create Innovative Content
What you put on your blog - The content - is of supreme importance; you aren’t going to attract brands and clients if you don’t produce innovative content on a regular basis. 

Think about what your target audience wants to see and read about. Conduct market research so you can truly tap into their brains and write posts that excite them and spark discussions. Your aim is to get people to engage with your blog and share your content, ideally so that it goes viral. Put yourself into your audience’s shoes and write about things that truly matter to them.

### Be Patient
It takes time to become [a successful blogger](https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-be-a-successful-blogger/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, sadly you can’t rush the process. It will take patience to build up a following and get your name out into the world so that brands can notice you. 

It will be a lengthy, but rewarding process. It won't be without it's own stresses and overwhelm at times, but it will all be worth it in the end. Put the hard work in and you will get all of the benefits of a successful and lucrative business.

So watch your blog blossom into a fully fledged business and enjoy the process of being a self made entrepreneur.
