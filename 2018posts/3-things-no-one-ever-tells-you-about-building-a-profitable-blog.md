# 3 Things No One Ever Tells You About Building A Profitable Blog
*This post may contain affiliate links*

### It’s easy to think that creating a successful blog is relatively simple. This is primarily due to the fact that there are so many blogs out there today! 

Many think you just start a blog, [write about what you love](http://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/write-about-what-you-love.html){:target="_blank"}, and then the money comes rolling in. 

On the contrary, it’s harder than that, and there are plenty of things no one ever mentions about building a profitable blog. Today, I reveal some of those things so that you can be in a better position to start your side hustle and make money.

### 1. It's pretty much a job
Many people view blogging as a little hobby that you can do on the side when you’re bored. That’s a fine way to look at it, and many people approach blogging in this way. But, when we’re talking about building a **profitable** blog, then you need to think differently. Here's what most bloggers never tell you: running a blog that makes money is basically a job. It requires frequent attention, and is necessary to put in plenty of hours every day throughout the week. The difference is that it’s a job you’re in control of, so you can be as flexible as you want with it. Generally speaking, the more time you devote to it, the more successful it will be. Some of the biggest and [most profitable blogs](https://www.targetinternet.com/our-analysis-of-10-top-paid-bloggers-2017/){:target="_blank"} are run by people that see blogging as a full-time commitment. So, bear that in mind if you want to give it a go.

### 2. Blogs require investment
If you want to make your blog as big and profitable as can be, then you need to **invest in it**. Building a blog isn’t free. Well it can be, but you’ll rarely see profitable results from a blog using free services - there are too many restrictions on what you can and can't do. Money is generally needed to ensure the design is unique and up to scratch, to secure a domain name,  for advertising, and so on. This may feel like a stumbling block if you think you don’t have enough cash to invest in your blog. However, there are sites such as [https://personalloan.co/](https://personalloan.co/){:target="_blank"} where it's possible to get small loans to help if needed. Obviously do your research  if you're getting a loan, to find one with the smallest APR that's available, don't borrow more than you can easily repay, and try to keep the repayment duration short.  At the end of the day, if you have confidence in your blog - and need to give it a little push - then you should invest in it to make it better.

### 3. Retaining readers is harder than gaining new ones
Everyone thinks that gaining new readers is the primary aim of a blog. If new people keep finding and reading your content, then surely you’ll make money, right? Not always, especially if you aren’t retaining your audience. It’s tough to get people to stay on your blog and keep coming back every day. You really need to focus on a [target audience](https://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2011/09/19/these-tips-will-help-define-your-blogs-target-audience/){:target="_blank"} and create content that is easy for them to engage with and provides value to their day. This ensures they keep coming back and don’t get bored of what you offer. 


I hope that, by learning of the things no one ever tells you about building a profitable blog, you will be in a better position to consider whether you plan to start one. It's better to know all the facts up-front. I can say that building a blog can not only be very profitable, it's also a very rewarding way to earn an income!
