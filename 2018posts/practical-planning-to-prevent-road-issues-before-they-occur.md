### The old saying is that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In the event of a road accident, an ounce of prevention is worth several hundred tonnes of cure.

It’s essential to understand that while good reflexes could help you out of a difficult road situation, learning good driving habits, nurturing your best [road attitude](https://fluidthinking.shell.co.uk/2017/03/31/10-tips-for-driving-on-country-roads/){:target="_blank"} and keenly reading the road will always be superior preventative steps.

[There are methods](http://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/How-To-Pick-A-Profitable-Book-Niche.html) you can take to insure that a potential road accident either does not happen, or is limited in its difficulty to the best degree possible. It’s always good to absorb a refresher as far as this topic is concerned, so consider these practical planning steps to prevent road issues before they occur:

### Insurance

It’s always important to stay insured as your first priority. There is no more important and legal consideration to consider than this. You can dictate the terms of your cover, but possessing cover is non-negotiable. This helps you settle claims if involved in an accident, and gives you legal backing to seek reparations or compensation if faulted against on the road. Thankfully, this needn’t cost you as much as a claim would. [Cheapautoinsurance.co](https://cheapautoinsurance.co/){:target="_blank"} can help you choose from the most reliable plans for you, and help you drive with peace of mind knowing you’re protected at all times.

### Focus, Awareness, Distractions

Many seem to think that once they are legally qualified to drive, they can do whatever they like in their vehicle as long as they have control of the road. This is false, you never have control of the road, only your vehicle. No matter how young you are and how excited you are for that road trip, establishing ground rules in your vehicle is essential to ensure everyone has a happy time on the road. This means asking people to lessen screaming, very loud singing to the music, or perhaps keeping the music at a quiet volume all along. 

Absolutely no one has the right to dictate your focus levels while driving aside from you. This means you need to take care in how you conduct yourself in the driving seat of your vehicle, and learn to articulate your needs from others. If they cannot follow those rules, they should not be welcome in your car. It’s as simple as that.

### Road Comfort

#### Road Rules Refreshment

Everyone becomes rusty from time to time. It might be that you have trouble recalling what that odd road sign says that you rarely see, or perhaps you’re slightly unsure as to the exact meaning of a mark in the road in a strange lane configuration. In order to ensure you follow the traffic code to the letter, refreshing yourself on your driving theory knowledge can help you. Taking online tests or perhaps reading through the signage or best practices from time to time can help jog your memory. The more you do this, the more the knowledge will become long term and useful.

With these practical planning tips to prevent road issues before they occur, you’ll likely enjoy long term road safety.
