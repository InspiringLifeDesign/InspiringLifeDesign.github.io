# The Top Three Strategies That Can Help You Achieve F.I.R.E.

### For many of us, being financially independent and retiring early (F.I.R.E) is the ultimate goal to aspire to. 

After all, who wants to be stuck behind a desk well into their 60's, still working for <i>the man</i>, when there's so much life to experience <i>out there</i>? Well, not me that's for sure, and that's why I have been researching possible ways to achieve my F.I.R.E goal. Read on to find out more...
 
### Invest In Property
One way to make money for F.I.R.E is to invest. Now, there are many types of investment to consider, but the one I've been looking at recently is property. The reason for this is because property is a unique type of investment, you can not only profit from it in the long term, but also take advantage of it in the short term by living in it, using it as a vacation home, or even renting it out to others.

Although, before you part with the vast sums of money that are involved in purchasing property it's a smart move to do some thorough research and [browse rental apartments](https://www.meriton.com.au/rent-apartments/sydney/){:target="_blank"} in the areas you are considering. Then you will be able to get an idea of the costs involved, standards available, and understand what is currently popular. 

It's also useful to compare different locations and get some predictions on which areas will see the most substantial price increase in the long term as well.  Especially if you are hoping to hold onto the property for 5-10 years or more.  

### Create A Passive Income
Next, you may wish to consider setting up a passive income stream to help you get closer to your F.I.R.E. goal. There are a huge range of possibilities to choose from, so it's likely that you can find something that will not only be profitable but may be enjoyable as well.

Writing a book allows you to get paid for sharing your experience and knowledge. 

For example, artistically minded people may choose to focus on creating graphic design elements or organisation sheets. While those that have a particular passion or interest could consider [writing a book](/posts/How-To-Pick-A-Profitable-Book-Niche.html){:target="_blank"} on that subject. 

### Blog For Cash
OK, so you rarely ever get actual cash in notes when you monetise your blog, but you can definitely get paid for running it. In fact, there are several approaches you can consider. One is to allow content marketing companies to display their posts on your site. Something that you can get paid for, and it's usually dependent on how many followers you have.

Another option [is affiliate marketing](https://www.bigcommerce.com.au/blog/affiliate-marketing/){:target="_blank"}. This is where you have an agreement with a single brand and host links on your site that take visitors directly to their shop to make a purchase. 

Of course, you'll have to find some natural way of working such links in, so be ready to review and discuss many different types of products. Also, most schemes pay out when a purchase is made, not based on the traffic you direct to the site. Something it's worth being aware of before you go decide to go ahead and add this money making hustle to your F.I.R.E arsenal.
