### There are few things more important to [*any business*](/posts/5-money-making-reasons-to-publish-books.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} than its employees. They really are the beating heart of any business and without them, it's likely that things would slow to a crawl or even shut down entirely. 

However, it's a mistake to assume that this is something that only really applies to very large businesses. On the contrary, whether you have three employees or three-hundred, they are always an essential part of any company. And yet, much smaller businesses often have a habit of ignoring the needs of their employees all too often. With that in mind, here are some ways that your small business can focus on taking care of its employees.
 
### Care and support
One of the biggest mistakes that you can make as an employer is to treat your employees like machines that you can just put wages into and get productivity out. Your employees are people and people have needs and limitations that you need to be aware of. You need to support your employees and show them that you care. This can be in incredibly simple ways like recognising and rewarding high-quality work, to creating an atmosphere where your employees feel comfortable coming to you with any issues that they might have, whether that's with their work, other employees, or even the business itself. An open door policy is one of the very best ways to raise employee engagement and morale.

### Training
One thing that you need to remember is that your business might not be the ultimate goal for many of your employees. Whether they're planning on moving up through your company or moving on to bigger things, most employees want at least some sense of progression in their career. Because of that, [offering them training](https://www.uscreen.tv/blog/6-types-online-employee-training-programs/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to help them develop their skills is essential. Plus, it's a win-win since not only are you helping them progress, but their ability to do their job is going to get better and better, which benefits you just as much as them.

### A health plan
Taking care of your employees' health is one of those things that is incredibly important and yet often neglected. If you don't have a workforce that is operating at 100% then that can drag your business down. From offering health coverage to life insurance from a company like [mykeymaninsurance.com](https://www.mykeymaninsurance.com/relevant-life-policy/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a strong health plan for your employees not only shows them that you care but it also can help to bring the best possible people into your business as they see exactly what kinds of benefits they can expect from it.

It might seem as though all of this is a pretty major investment of both money and time, two things which are often in pretty short supply for a small startup. However, your employees are so important that, if there is anything that is worth spending that time and money on, it's them. If you end up neglecting your employees, you're setting up your business to fail before it's even had a chance to get off the ground.
