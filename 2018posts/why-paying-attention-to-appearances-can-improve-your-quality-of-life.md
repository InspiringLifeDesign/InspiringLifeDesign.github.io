### As we all know, you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, and true beauty is something found on the inside, not the outside.

These well-worn sayings have stood the test of time because, of course, they are true. You really shouldn’t put external appearances over vastly more important internal qualities, such as integrity, truthfulness, and industriousness.

But just because you shouldn’t place appearance in the number one position in your hierarchy of values, doesn’t mean that appearances are worth nothing. Or to be more exact, it doesn’t mean that *presentation* is worth nothing.

No matter what sort of home you live in, what sort of car you drive, or what sort of bone structure you’ve inherited, there are better and worse ways of presenting yourself, your vehicle, and your home.

Here are some reasons why paying attention to appearances can improve your quality of life, and the [amount of fun](/posts/autumn-bucket-list.html){:target="_blank"} you have...

### Taking care of your appearance boosts your self-confidence and reinforces the idea that you’re worth caring about
The way you present yourself, and manage the appearance of your belongings, isn’t just a matter of putting on a show for other people. To a large extent, it’s actually a matter of putting on a show for yourself.

Whether or not you’ve ever really noticed it before, when you put effort into presenting yourself in your best light, you also send a clear message to your subconscious mind that you’re someone who’s worth respecting and investing in.

The key here is presentation, rather than basic appearance. If you have a Mercedes Benz, for example, but you’ve let it get badly dented and scratched up, getting it repaired at a [Mercedes body shop](https://www.lshauto.co.uk/aftersales/cosmetic-repairs/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} would be likely to boost your confidence, wheras failing to do this may diminish it.

Likewise with your physical appearance. You could be naturally attractive, but if you wear old tracksuits everywhere, you’re sending yourself a signal that you’re not really worth the effort.

### People naturally respond better to those who put effort into their presentation
Now, some of the reason why paying attention to appearances can improve your quality of life is, of course, because other people tend to respond more positively to those who make an effort in their presentation.

While you shouldn’t become obsessed with the idea of impressing others, it is worth considering that those who dress more professionally tend to progress further in their careers, while those who keep a [tidier home](https://www.onekingslane.com/live-love-home/marie-kondo-book-declutter/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and more stylish look are generally seen as more desirable, socially.

### Making an effort to present yourself well can be fun
Have you ever noticed that a lot of people seem to have a really good time shopping for the latest furniture or items of interior decor, not to mention compulsively clothes shopping?

At least part of the reason for this is that making an effort to present yourself can be, well, fun.

Just as a little girl might have a great time choosing outfits for her toy doll, so do grownups have the capacity to treat dressing up as a fun game.

And just as a child might enjoy painting their “[dream house](http://www.dreamhomesmagazine.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}” drawing in vivid colours, so too can you learn to enjoy real life interior decor.
