### Well, it doesn’t have to be, but most of us like making it that way. 

Managing money can be really tricky, especially if you’ve got yourself into a pickle or two along the way. Because it’s so easy for money to fly out of our bank accounts quicker than it ever came in. But, when money is so precious, you should be doing everything in your path to make sure that you manage it as well as you can. If you’re not doing the best job of it at the minute, I want to try and help you out. As tough as managing money might be, there are ways that you can make it easier on both yourself, and your finances. I think I’ve got a few ways that you can not only manage your money more effectively, but you can also move your finances forward so that you feel in a more comfortable position overall. If you’re in need of a little help, have a read of the information below, and see if it can turn your finances around.

### The Dreaded Taxes
You might not ever have to deal with taxes. If you’re employed under a full time basis, part time, or anything else in between, then your employer will pay your taxes. However, if you're self employed, have started up a small business on the side, or you’ve gone down the route of giving investment a go, then you’re going to have to deal with taxes. It all might seem really intimidating, but when you dig deeper, it really isn’t. Don’t feel that you have to jump to hiring an accountant to do it for you. They charge high fees, and you can file your own taxes so easily without any hassle. All you have to do is input the right data, calculate your expenditures, and use the online form or software to calculate your tax amount. In the UK it's easy to file a self assessment tax return online using the government's site. Taking each section of the form bit by bit can make filling in the form less daunting. As long as you work out your figures, check them, and check them again, you shouldn’t have any issues. In the USA, you can also [get updated tax software](http://isitvivid.com/how-to-make-doing-your-own-taxes-easy/){:target="_blank"} that will help you with all of the calculations. It’s like hiring a little accountant, without the big fees (there are fees, just a lot smaller than traditional accountancy). This software can be used year on year, and will never fail you. It’s the backup you’re needing if you’re worried about getting everything wrong. 

Getting everything wrong could cost you big time. Filing the wrong tax return information can result in hefty fines, investigations, and just trouble that you don’t want to deal with. The best plan is to make sure that you’re keeping records of everything throughout the tax year (including the all important receipts), and that all of your information is up to date.

### Dealing With Issues As & When

If you want to manage your money, but you’re finding it hard to do, then chances are you aren’t dealing with issues **as and when they come in**. It's understandable, if things start going wrong we like to think that we can deal with them later on and that they won’t get worse as the weeks go on. Wrong. 

Let’s take debt for example. Debt is more common than most of us care to let on. Say for example, you have a credit card with a little more charged on it than you would like, don’t panic. It's important to try not to worry about it, but rather formulate a plan to tackle it head on. You may be trying to ignore the fact that you’re spending on your credit card more than you are your normal account, and your balance is just going up and up. This is an issue you need to deal with, and [the quickest way to deal with it](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jan/07/steps-to-reduce-debt){:target="_blank"} is to chop that card right up. Then, focus on paying it back at a reasonable amount. Take your time, don’t put your finances under pressure, and slowly reduce your limit as you pay it off as well. If you have a higher limit, you’ll be more tempted to order a new card and start spending again. But, if you reduce the limit as you make the payments, temptation is removed and over time things should become easier for you.

### Repairing Your Credit Score

Your credit score is so important to your finances, but too many people ignore the damages that might be happening to it. For example, if you’re always trying to take out finance, the credit check that the companies use will knock your credit score a bit. If you’ve got a credit card and you’re failing to make your minimum payments, then your credit score is definitely going to be taking a big hit. If your credit score has taken a serious hit, then don’t think it’ll be [an overnight one hit wonder to fix it](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/12-simple-steps-to-repair-your-credit-and-increase.html){:target="_blank"}. It’ll take months, maybe even years to rectify. But, take it one step at a time and you can make improvements. First of all, work through your debts, this will raise your credit score. Then, try to get rid of any negative comments. It could be that you’re always in an overdraft, you’ve got multiple bank accounts open, or you keep creating new ones. The sooner you can improve your credit score, the brighter your financial future will look.

### Incoming & Outgoings

The final piece of the puzzle. [Incomings](/posts/june-2018-income-report.html){:target="_blank"} and outgoings are hard to manage because they can vary so much. The best way to manage them is by doing a monthly plan. This can either be done using pen and paper, a spreadsheet (my personal favourite) or you can use one of a growing number of financial apps to keep things organised. 

It's worth remembering to exercise some flexibility with any budgets that you make. They're best treated as a guide rather than trying to stick rigidly to them. Bear this in mind because it's not healthy to get into a position where you're constantly beating yourself up over your finances. Your friends might ask you out for a meal, your car might have a fault, you may want to take advantage of an unexpected opportunity…anything at all could scupper your best laid plans! You can help protect your budget by putting aside an amount of money in your savings and treating this as an emergency fund. That way, if you have to dip in for something unexpected, you have it there waiting for you!


So, try not to stress when managing your money. Stress clouds your vision the most. Take every day as it comes, and work through your issues as and when you have them!
