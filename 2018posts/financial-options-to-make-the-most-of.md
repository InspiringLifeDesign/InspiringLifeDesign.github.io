### Hire a Finance Coach
So you need financial guidance, but you don’t really know where to start? The best thing to do is to [hire a finance coach](https://financialmentor.com/financial-coaching/benefits/top-15-reasons-to-hire-a-money-coach){:target="_blank"} to help you out.

### Work an Extra Job 
You may choose to improve your finances by focusing on increasing the money you are bringing in. One way to do this is to consider working an extra job to generate more revenue. Without a doubt, this will improve your financial security for you and your family and helps ensure you are more financially comfortable. The great news these days is that there are so many more options available than ever before when it comes to working from home. [Working online via e-commerce](https://selfstartr.com/start-ecommerce-business/){:target="_blank"}, blogging, or writing are great ideas for an extra job without even having to leave the comfort of your own home! 

### Save More Cash
Saving money is actually more important than you might think, yet many find that it is one of the hardest things to do. Even [saving an extra £1,000 in a year](/posts/save-one-thousand-pounds.html){:target="_blank"} may seem daunting, but if you break it down and take one week or month at a time it's actually possible to get saving. Consider turning saving into a game (a bit like the weekly scratch-off in the linked post), or set yourself mini savings targets to hit along the way. Start by building up an emergency fund that feels right for you, then consider what other larger things you may want to save for (holidays, weddings, retirement).

If you can get saving, it will give you **peace of mind** and make things much more comfortable for you, giving you a **nice buffer** to fall back on should you need it.
