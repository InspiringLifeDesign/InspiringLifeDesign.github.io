# The Link Between Policies And Poverty

### Most people have an opinion when it comes to government policies on poverty, and this is a subject that has triggered fierce debate over the decades.
While politicians will probably always come under fire for the decisions they make, there have been improvements in the US. As this infographic shows, poverty rates have fallen in the 20th and 21st centuries.

In 1959, 27.3% of the population was living in poverty, compared to 21.1% in 2014. There have been particularly drastic improvements in rates of poverty among senior citizens, with the figure falling from 35.2% in 1959 to 10% in 2014. Another important statistic to consider is average personal income, which has almost doubled in the US since 1970.

Every president enters the White House hoping to make a difference, but there are certain policies that command attention when exploring the impact of politics on poverty. In 1935, Franklin D. Roosevelt passed the Social Security Act, a policy that would pave the way for poverty reduction for decades to come. The act targeted the vulnerable, providing benefits for over 65s and the unemployed. Roosevelt was also influential in creating employment opportunities thanks to the establishment of the Civilian Conservation Corps and $4 billion worth of investment in public buildings.

In 1965, Lyndon B. Johnson passed amendments to the Social Security Act, widening the range of benefits and launching Medicare and Medicaid. This move undoubtedly contributed to the dramatic decline in poverty rates among over 64s. President Johnson also introduced food stamps in 1964. By 1974, 15 million people were benefiting from the scheme.

More recently, Social Security lifted over 22 million Americans out of poverty in 2012. It is estimated that, in total, the government policies outlined in this infographic have reduced the number of people living in poverty by over 48 million.
