# Iconic Libraries Of The World: Then And Now

### Libraries have played an influential role in learning and community engagement for centuries. 

If you’re wondering how modern libraries came to be, it’s well worth learning more about the history of these literary treasure chests by taking a look at some of the world’s most iconic libraries.

The infographic below highlights some of the world’s most high-profile and significant libraries. The US is home to hundreds of libraries, but perhaps the most iconic are the Library of Congress in Washington and The Library Company in Philadelphia. Today, the Library of Congress is the research arm of Congress and it remains the largest library in the US. It houses millions of books and artifacts, including over 5.5 million pieces in the Geography and Map Division alone. Philadelphia’s distinguished library was founded by Benjamin Franklin and it boasts more than 2,000 items previously owned by the Founding Father.

The British Museum in London is another gem. This library is renowned for the diversity of its collections, and every year, the equivalent of 7 miles worth of books and artifacts are added. Entry to the library is free, and this is a must for any fans of history and literature visiting London. 

One of the newest additions to the list is Japan’s Musashino Art University Library. This facility was designed to be the most simplistic and understated library in the world. A far cry from the grandiose of the British Library and Austria’s famous Admont Library, this facility features wooden shelves stacked with books and glass walls that reflect the light. The building, which was completed in 2010, also boasts stunning artwork.
