### How many times do you postpone doing the things that you love and matter the most to you? If you're like most people, it must be countless times, with the hope that you'll do them later. 

Unfortunately, this time may never come, and before you realise it, [time has slowly passed you by](https://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/10-years-left-to-live.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

If you missed doing something yesterday for one reason or another, the next best time to do it is today. That goes for the road trip you’ve been putting off for months on end now. If you need some inspiration to plan the perfect road trip, here are insights to get you started. 

### Get a Road-Ready Car
Before you head on the highway to your [anticipated destination](https://www.vroomvroomvroom.com/road-trips/10-best-scenic-drives-usa/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, ensure your car is working at its best. Car troubles can quickly turn your fun-filled tour into a nightmare. Your checklist should include ensuring the tyres have enough tread. Consider replacing them if they appear worn out, which also calls for car alignment if they’re unevenly worn out.

Top up all fluids, including the windshield washer fluid, transmission fluid, and oil. Check also that you have enough power steering fluid, brake fluid, and antifreeze. 

Other components that need your attention are the lights, wiper blades, brakes, and toolkit. If possible, bring your car for a professional checkup. If you’re short on time and can’t wait to have the car checked, consider going to somewhere like [SUV cars on Motability](https://www.swanswaygarages.com/motability/offers/suv/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for a road-ready vehicle. SUVs are also better suited for road trips than regular cars because they have more legroom.

### Choose a Destination
Sometimes it’s fun to just set out to no particular place, but having a destination in mind helps. That way you’ll know how much time you expect to be out and how much money you intend to spend. You also get an idea of the potential attractions you expect to see on your route. See if there are any scenic routes off the interstate highways for more exciting views.

Having a destination in mind also helps you plan how many stopovers you can make and how long to drive. It’s recommended not to drive [for more than eight hours a day](https://lazytrips.com/blog/how-far-is-it-safe-to-drive-in-one-day){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. This accounts for the breaks you need to take and also other external factors.  

### Pack Up Some Essentials
Think of what you would consider as essential items for your road trip. For example, you might need a change of clothes just in case you’ll be out for several days. Other important items could include your sunglasses, a spare car key and any medication you need to take. It's always a good idea to bring some snacks and drinks to chase the hunger pangs before a stop-over, and of course don’t forget drinking water.

### Remember to Bring Some Entertainment
Everyone appreciates some good music on a long trip, and these days it's even possible to use devices to watch films or downloads TV episodes. Of course you must be sure you don’t bring anything that will distract the driver while driving - remember safety matters.

Other ideas to keep passengers entertained include crossword puzzles, travel journals, DVD players, MP3 players, or magazines. And for a bit of fun for everyone you could always consider listening to some podcasts, quizzzes or audiobooks which won't detract from driving concentration.

### Final Thoughts
Road trips can be considered a welcome treat, especially if you've been working hard & saving toward your financial freedom. If you plan your road trip properly, you’ll have so much to experience. The memories you create will be enough to last you a lifetime.
