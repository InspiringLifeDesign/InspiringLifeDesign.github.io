### Becoming self-employed is one of the most rewarding and empowering career moves that you can make. 

With it, comes [freedom](https://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/freedom-plan-part-1.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, flexibility, opportunity, and the chance to be your own boss. Betting on yourself takes a lot of courage, and it should be celebrated. However, it involves certain risks that many people prefer not to make.

Although this isn’t an extraordinarily high figure, the 5 million people within this sector represent an all-time high. Increasing numbers of people are looking to freelancing or entrepreneurial ventures to make a living. 

The modern worker often values quality of life and overall happiness over any other factor when making career decisions. This attitude is pushing people beyond the safety net of a reliable and more traditional occupation. 
As mentioned, being self-employed involves risk. Going solo requires a lot of work, and certain pitfalls must be avoided. If you’ve decided to take the plunge and try your hand at becoming self-employed, here are five top tips.

### Stick to a detailed business plan
For the majority of self-employed people, a business plan is an absolute must. The only exceptions are in certain freelance contracting roles, where your projects vary from client to client. 

No successful company can survive without a tangible business plan that outlines the company’s purpose, goals, targets, strategy, and how it aims to make a profit. Create a detailed plan that covers all bases. 

Once your plan is in place, you must stick to it. Create prioritised task lists, use a business calendar, generate a schedule, and carry out whatever you need to effectively execute your plan. 

### Organise paperwork and documents
Don’t let administrative work pile up and ensure that your documents are filed in an organised and structured way. Make use of a filing cabinet and use a detailed digital filing system to organise computer-based documents.

No matter your industry, prioritise insurance for your business. Research specialised companies for the best value. For example, some brokers or companies have dedicated branches for supplying [taxi insurance quotes](https://www.onesureinsurance.co.uk/taxi-insurance){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
