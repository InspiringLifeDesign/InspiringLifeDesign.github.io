### Monetising your blog is something a lot of people want to do; if you’re online on a regular basis, and you put <a href="https://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/write-about-what-you-love.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color:purple;">your thoughts and opinions</a> out there for everyone to view, you’ll likely want to make a little bit of profit for your time at least! 

But when it comes to setting up your blog for monetisation, you need to be sure you’re doing so correctly. After all, you can make a lot of mistakes here, and it’s always key to double check you’re using the best methods from time to time. So, without further ado, here are some things to think about in terms of monetisation methods, to make sure that your blog is making a good profit whatever the weather. 

### Focus on Your SEO
SEO is something every single website uses to ensure they’re as near to the top of Google search as they can be. When you’re trying to monetise your blog, SEO is what drives traffic towards your posts, and ensures there’s more than enough people clicking your links. Now more than ever your SEO is going to need a lot of focus; you want to corner your niche as best as possible, and that takes a lot of work! 

Feel like you need a quick crash course? Check out [On-SERP SEO explained by Herdl](https://herdl.com/on-serp-seo/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for all you need to know. The key message here is be sure you understand how SEO works, and how you can optimise it across everything you’ve ever published online to ensure it’s still relevant and attractive to any potential viewers to your blog. 

### Work with the Best Affiliate Programs
Affiliate programs can vary in their quality. If you’ve signed up to a bad one you're missing out on maximising the money that you can make from your blog. So, take a look at your affiliate links and see how much they’ve made over the course of their lifetime - is the amount negligible? Then maybe you’re not working with the right program, or placing the right links - it’s time to change that. 

There are many different affiliate programs available to join as a blogger. Some offer opportunities to work with multiple companies, others are individually run by a company itself. For example, I am an affiliate for Amazon products and work directly with them, but I'm also signed up to affiliate sites such as CJ and Awin.

Deciding whether to maintain an affiliate partnership or not should be very simple: if the product(s) is relevant to you and your blog's niche it’s worth it because you'll naturally be writing about it. Of course, if the product you're promoting is completely random, you've only got it there for the money - your readers will be able to tell - so it’s time to kill that link. 

### Sell Your Expertise 
You can also turn to selling your expertise on a topic to people who need help with it or are just curious about learning more. You can start writing ebooks and monetise those very easily by self publishing them. You can come up with a whole [online learning course](https://www.thinkific.com/blog/10-steps-creating-successful-online-course/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for people to pay for a single time - depending on the amount and quality of content, the prices here can be huge, and imagine if even just 10 people paid £100 for it in a single month! 

Your blog needs monetising in the right way. Make sure you follow tips like these to ensure you’re making as much profit as possible from your online activity; there are plenty out there!
