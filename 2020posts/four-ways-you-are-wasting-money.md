### We all like to think we’re good at managing money but, in reality, most of us waste money without even realising it. 

If you want to ensure you’re making the most of your income, be sure to undertake a regular audit of your finances. By making small changes to the way you live, it’s surprisingly easy to lower your outgoings and increase your savings. To get started, take a look at 4 ways you could be wasting money without realising:

### 1. Signing Up for Free Trials
[Free trials](https://www.vice.com/en/article/43zvwm/cancel-free-trial){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} are always tempting, particularly if it’s for a service or product that you’re thinking about buying. However, free trials are rarely available without terms and conditions, so you could be signing up for more than you’ve bargained for.
You may get the first month free but be tied into a 12-month contract, for example. Alternatively, you may forget to cancel your subscription when the trial ends. If you do sign up for a free trial, be sure to read the small print first and schedule a notification so that you know exactly when you need to cancel your membership.

### 2. Paying Too Much for Insurance
Having house or car insurance is very much essential if you want to protect your assets. What’s more – all vehicles on the road need to be insured according to the law. However, if you’re simply renewing your policies each year without looking for better deals, it’s likely you’re spending more than you need to. To learn how to reduce the cost of your insurance, [find out more](https://www.callwiser.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} now. By making tweaks to your policy and comparing providers, you’ll be amazed at how much you can save.

### 3. Paying ATM Fees
In today’s digital era, you can pay for most things by card but there are times when you’ll need to access cash. Before you take cash out of your account, it’s important to determine whether you’ll incur any fees. Many ATMs now charge £2-3 per transaction, which can add up to a significant amount if you take cash out regularly. Look for free ATMs or, alternatively, visit your bank or building society during opening hours to avoid paying additional fees.

### 4. Buying Reduced Items
Buying products when they’re reduced can be a good way to [save money](/financial-freedom/index.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, providing you were planning to buy them anyway. When we see something that looks like a good deal, it’s easy to persuade ourselves that we’re making a saving. However, a £10 item reduced to half price still costs £5. If you weren’t planning to buy it at full price, you won’t actually be making a saving when it’s reduced.

### Make Your Money Go Further
When you begin to identify the ways you’re wasting money without realising it, it’s easy to see where you can make savings. By adjusting the way you handle your finances, you can stretch your income further and give yourself peace of mind. What’s more – you’ll have more disposable income to spend or save each month!
