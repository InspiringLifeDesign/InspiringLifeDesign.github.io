### Buying a house should be an exciting time but with everything that’s happened throughout 2020 you may be feeling slightly anxious about the whole purchasing process.
Believe it or not, the housing market improved significantly in August, with mortgage approvals at their highest point since 2007. This is great news and should offer some encouragement for your homebuying plans. 

But what do homebuyers want out of a property when we enter a post-lockdown world? This blog post will look at three things buyers will want in a home post-COVID-19. 

### A change of scenery
Having been cooped up for most of the year buyers are now looking for different locations to move to. The pandemic has made a lot of people want that open space or access to a garden and sometimes you can’t get that in the city, which is why people are starting to look elsewhere to towns and villages to get away from it all in favour of rural life.

If you are looking to move to a completely different and new location, you will want to talk with [estate agents](https://www.jordanandhalstead.co.uk/hazel-grove/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in the area you are looking to move to. Whether it’s a lovely spot in the countryside or a small town, speak to those in the know who will be able to provide you with all the necessary information. 

### Sizing up
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us all that [life changes](/posts/life-update.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} very quickly. Second-time buyers are now looking to size up to larger homes for more space. This is because people have spent a lot of time working from home, a trend that looks to continue as we enter the post-lockdown world. 

Businesses have changed a number of their processes and how they work and some companies are looking to continue a work from home strategy, whether it’s permanently or a few days a week. This means people need an office space at home where they can be productive and without distraction. 

Families are also looking for extra space to create playrooms so their children have somewhere to play. With being in lockdown for months, it can have a negative effect on people’s mental health, so the added space could be beneficial to many. 

### Houses and bungalows over flats
There’s no denying that the pandemic has had an impact on the housing property and what people are looking for in a home. Flats don’t offer that outdoor space that people now crave, which is why so many people are looking to buy bungalows and houses over a flat. Perhaps this may be positive news for first time buyers if the cost of flats and apartments reduces due to lesser demand, this could offer that first vital step onto the property ladder.

[According to Rightmove](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/news/articles/property-news/rightmove-survey-home-hunters-want-bigger-gardens/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} a private outdoor space or garden is one of the most requested features now, as well as a garage or parking space. Houses and bungalows are also better for those who have or want pets. 

COVID-19 has certainly shifted people’s opinions on what is important to them, in their everyday life but also what they want out of their home. Being forced to spend more time indoors has given people a new perspective and has made many look to the future to help them decide what the best option is for themselves and their family.
