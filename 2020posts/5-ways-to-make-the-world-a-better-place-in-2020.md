### There’s no denying that 2020 has been a difficult year for everyone. The worldwide pandemic has had a far-reaching impact worldwide, and there is not a person on the planet who hasn’t been touched by it in some way.

In such uncertain times, it can be tempting to take a pessimistic worldview and bemoan everything that is wrong with the planet. But this behaviour can be harmful. The glass-half-full outlook doesn’t help anyone, and it can ultimately be damaging to your mental health.

It’s more important than ever to maintain a positive outlook about the world and its future. After all, there are many things to feel good about. Although coronavirus has forced people to separate physically, it has [brought us together](https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/uplifting-stories-coronavirus){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} spiritually in ways never seen before. People have clubbed together to raise money, help those in need, and bring joy to the world in our darkest times.

It’s clear that it will take a lot more than a virus to crush the spirit of humankind, and these uplifting stories offer a glimpse of a bright future for everyone. But at the moment, we are still in the middle of the pandemic. Lives are still at risk, businesses are shut down, and many people are stuck at home isolating. Yet this doesn’t mean we need to sit tight and wait for things to get better. There are plenty of actions you can take right now to make the world a better place for the future. Here are just a few examples.

### 1. Help those in need
Some people around the world are in more fortunate positions than others right now. Many are still able to go to work and get paid as usual. Plenty of people are able to see their loved ones without having to worry about their health. Yet many people have it a lot worse. There are elderly and sick people living alone and unable to see their families. Many workers have lost their jobs and are [struggling to make ends meet](/posts/cash-this-week.html). And of course, let’s not forget those who have sadly lost loved ones during the outbreak.

There are people in need everywhere. Now is the perfect time to do your bit for your fellow humans. There are many [ways you can help others](https://zenhabits.net/25-ways-to-help-a-fellow-human-being-today/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} right now. You can volunteer to help out with the pandemic, perhaps by bringing food to others, donating, or offering your skills to the relief effort. Some people have been signing up for medical trials to help speed up the development of a vaccine, while others have been creating online events and entertainment to cheer up people stuck in lockdown.

You’d even be making a difference by helping someone with their shopping or smiling at a stranger in the street. We could all use a bit more generosity and kindness in our lives right now, so do what you can to spread happiness and positivity to others.

### 2. Follow the rules
With the situation developing all the time, it can be difficult to know what the rules are at any one time. Government guidance is always changing and can sometimes be confusing and contradictory. But one thing is true: we are all responsible for our actions, and it is down to humanity as a whole to prevent the transmission of the virus. We can all play our part by following the rules as best we can and [minimising the spread](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/how-to-avoid-spreading-coronavirus-to-people-you-live-with/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. This means socially distancing from others, wearing a mask when required, and washing our hands frequently.

### 3. Respect the feelings of others
People have different opinions about the coronavirus situation as well as different ways of dealing with it. Some people hake a more cavalier approach, neglecting to wear face masks and choosing to see their family & friends even if this means breaking the latest rules. Others are much more cautious, many are even scared to leave the house for fear of catching the virus or exposing at risk loved ones. A simple trip to the supermarket brings waves of anxiety. 

Whatever your feelings about things, it’s important to remember that not everyone has the same views as you. You might have no problem squeezing past that shopper in the supermarket, but be aware that you might be causing them great discomfort. Some people don’t like talking about the latest facts and figures on the subject, so be empathetic when sharing your opinion. 

Everyone is different, so take care to remember that and respect their feelings.

### 4. Support struggling businesses
Hundreds of thousands of businesses worldwide have closed down this year, and many more are struggling. They need all the help they can get and rely on the support of the public to stay afloat. It’s the small, local businesses who are most at risk and you can help them out by giving them your custom. Try and shop local rather than going to larger chain stores. This might be a little more expensive, but you will be doing your bit for your community. This doesn’t mean you have to [delete your account](https://setapp.com/how-to/delete-amazon-account){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on Amazon or boycott big supermarkets, but try to help out the underdogs where you can. And it’s not just your money that will help. Spread the word about small businesses you love by writing reviews online or sharing your experiences with them on social media.

### 5. Do your bit for the planet
With everything going on in the world, many of us have neglected to think about that other big issue facing humankind: climate change. Although it may not have been at the forefront of our minds for the last several months, it’s still there and needs our attention. The pandemic will end, but our planet still needs help, and it’s up to all of us to play our part. You can incorporate little habits into your daily life that contribute towards [a greener world](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/29/50-ways-to-green-up-your-life-save-the-planet){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Conserve energy in your home, recycle, use green modes of transport and try to buy more environmentally friendly products. We can’t fix the planet in a single day, but change begins at home.

It’s crucial to stay positive, and not let the negative events of the world overwhelm us. By taking small actions for the greater good, we can work towards a better world and a brighter future.
