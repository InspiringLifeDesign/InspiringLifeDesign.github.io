### How often do you stop and think about the health of your eyes? The answer is probably never. 

When we think about [our health](https://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/changes-after-tony-robbins.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, we usually focus on areas such as our weight and our heart. Very seldom do we think about the health of our senses. 

But our senses are not something that we should take for granted. In fact, can you imagine if you lost your eyesight? What would you miss the most? Seeing loved ones? Favourite views? Watching TV? Being able to drive? There is a lot that we use our eyes for, so taking care of them should be a high priority. 

Of course, there is a lot that can go wrong with our eyes. There are many different age-related diseases that could affect us such as glaucoma or cataracts. Short and long-sightedness are common problems that affect a lot of people. Then there is the damage we can cause to our eyes without taking good care of them. 

So what can be done to take better care of our eyes? 

In this article, we’ll look at some of the many ways that you can look after your eyesight. Read on to find out more. 

### Visit Your Optician Often 

It is generally advised that you visit your optician for an eye examination at least once every two years. This may differ slightly if you have an existing eye condition. 

Your optician will carry out an eye exam to see if there have been any changes in your eyes or your eyesight since your last appointment. Problems with your eyes can come on quite rapidly, so it is important that your eyes are tested regularly. 

Your eye exam will consist of tests to see whether you are long or short-sighted. There may also be blind spot checks and tests for glaucoma. 

Following on from your visit to the optician, you may be advised to wear glasses. Your optician will provide you with a prescription. 

You can either buy your glasses from the optician or you can visit [www.eyeglasses.com](https://www.eyeglasses.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to find some specs that suit you best. 

### Wear the Glasses Your Optician Advises You To 

If you are told to wear glasses by your optician, then you should wear these. Even if you are only told to wear your glasses while doing certain activities such as reading, using a computer, or driving, it is essential that you do wear them because otherwise you might strain your eyes and cause them damage. If you do strain your eyes, this could also cause you to have headaches too.  

### Limit Your Screen Time 

If you are someone that spends a lot of time in front of computer screens or in front of a smartphone screen, then you could be harming your eyes.

When you spend a lot of time staring at a screen, you’ll strain your eyes. This will not only cause you headaches, but it may also damage your eyes. 

There are two things that you can do to help your eyes when you’re using screens. Firstly, wear special glasses that are designed to limit the glare from your screen, and secondly and most importantly; take regular breaks away from the screen. 

### Get Plenty of Vitamin A in Your Diet 

Your diet may not be the first thing that springs to mind when you think about taking good care of your eyesight, however, it is important that you eat the right foods to provide the proteins in your eyes with the right vitamins that they need. 

Foods that are high in beta carotenes such as carrots, squashes, sweet potatoes, and mangoes are all really good for your eyes. They are a great source of vitamin A. 

Vitamin A is something that is naturally found in rhodopsin which is the protein found in your eyes. This protein helps you see in dimly lit conditions- so eating carrots can help you see in the dark.  Vitamin A is important for keeping your cornea clear. 

### Avoid Staring at Direct Sunlight 

If you have ever looked at the sun, you’ll probably know that you will end up seeing bright flashes in your eyes for some time after. When you stare at the sun, it can seriously damage your eyes. Not only will looking in the direction of the sun cause your cornea to get sunburnt, but it will also burn your retinas and damage the tissue. This could cause lasting damage to your eyes. 

If you’re outside in the sun, even if there is cloud cover, you should still wear sunglasses. But you should be aware that you’ll need the right type of sunglasses to give you maximum protection. Wear a pair of sunglasses that provides [UV protection](https://knockaround.com/blogs/journal/what-is-uv400-protection){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} of 400 or more. 

### Quit Smoking 

If you are someone that smokes, you may want to consider the damage that it is doing to your eyesight. You will no doubt be aware of the problems that smoking can cause your lungs and heart, but you may not have factored your eyes into the risks involved.

Smoking increases the risks of developing age-related eye diseases. These might include cataracts or macular degeneration. 

If you do smoke, cut back and start to quit now, before you cause problems for your eyes. 

### Wear Protective Glasses

If you work in heavy industry, or in any job where there is a risk of anything at all getting into your eyes while you’re working, then you must wear protective goggles or a visor while you work. 

Your employers should provide you with the necessary protective equipment to do your job. If they don’t, you should speak to your manager or your union representative. 

Similarly, if you have a hobby or play a sport where there is a risk to your eyes, be sure that you wear goggles, a visor, or a helmet that covers your eyes to protect them. 

### Check Out Your Family History

There are more than 350 different hereditary eye diseases that you could develop. Knowing whether you have anyone in your family that has any of these can be helpful in ensuring that you don’t. 

Pay attention to conditions that your relatives have with your eyes and be sure and let your optician know about anything that other people in your family may have as they can look for the early warning signs in your eyes. 

Conditions that are hereditary include retinoblastoma, amblyopia, hyperopia, albinism, colour blindness, aniridia, night blindness, astigmatism, corneal dystrophies, glaucoma, [Leber congenital amaurosis](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/leber-congenital-amaurosis){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, retinitis pigmentosa, and keratoconus. 

### Avoid Air Conditioning 

When you are in the car, or on a plane, bus, or train, make sure that you point the air conditioning away from your face and your eyes. Air conditioning can dry out your eyes leaving them dehydrated and prone to developing ulcers. 

Instead, point the air conditioning down towards your body or your feet so that it does not go directly into your face. 

### Be Careful Handling Contact Lenses

If you wear contact lenses, you should take precautions to avoid developing an eye infection. Make sure that you always wash your hands before you either put your contact lenses in or take them out. 

Make sure that your contact lenses are cleaned every night using the recommended solution and as directed. You should also ensure that you replace your contact lenses once they reach the end of their natural life and as advised by your optician.
