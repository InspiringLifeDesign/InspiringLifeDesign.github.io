### Taking your business global may well be a dream of yours, especially if you’re doing quite well nationally. 

However, there are a number of things you’ll need to consider before you make this possible. Your business could have plenty of potential to operate globally, but the fact is, you’re going to need to make some changes before it’ll be right for the rest of the world. Read on for the things you might need to consider before you take your business global.

### Will Time Differences Make A Difference To How You Operate? 
Depending on where you would like your business to operate, you need to consider whether the time difference will make a big difference to how you do things. If you’re in the UK and your customer is in Las Vegas Nevada, they’re going to be 8 hours behind you. Other time differences can be even more extreme - in Australia you won’t even be on the *same day* as one another. Make sure you factor this into your operations going forward, for example with customer service options during international opening hours, and be sure you can handle the differences. 

### Where Will You Base Your Suppliers? 
Many businesses base their suppliers in other countries, sometimes Turkey, sometimes China, sometimes elsewhere. It all depends on what you’re manufacturing, your budget, and your ethics. Considering [where you base your suppliers](https://spendmatters.com/2019/10/17/5-easy-steps-to-better-manage-your-suppliers/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} can be tough, as you’ll want to think about:

* Shipping - is importing the goods going to do more harm than good? Is it going to be viable for your budget? 
* Workers - are workers being paid a fair wage? Are they working in good conditions? 
* Quality - are you trying to save by having your product produced in a cheaper factory? 
* Environment - are there any environmental concerns with the product or supplier? 

### How Will You Take Payments From People In Different Countries? 
You’ll also need to know how you’re going to take payments from people in various countries. You can collect payments from customers in their preferred currency with a [foreign currency account](https://www.airwallex.com/au/features/global-accounts){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, for instance. Bear in mind there may be some charges associated with accepting foreign payments. Providing multiple ways to pay is a good idea no matter how many countries you operate in. 

### What Will You Do About The Difference In Culture? 
The difference in culture is a biggy. You may need to change your entire marketing scheme, and perhaps even some elements of your brand if you want to grow and become popular in another cultural landscape. This is why it’s a good idea to think globally with your brand in mind from the very beginning. Be very careful with translation of certain materials and slogans too, as you don’t want to make a huge faux pas. 

### Are You Well Aware of Foreign Policies? 
Leverage local experts and ensure you’re aware of important foreign policies. 

### How Will You Prepare Employees For International Customers? 
[Training your employees for international customers](https://resources.bureauworks.com/how-to-manage-international-employee-training-fc){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is essential, too. Make sure everybody is prepared for the change and what it could mean.
