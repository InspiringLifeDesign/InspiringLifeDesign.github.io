### If you've always wanted to be a writer, it’s something that you may not be able to stop thinking about. 

Yet, unless you get started, it’ll only ever stay a dream. So, you need to make sure that you know what it takes to be a writer. Sometimes it seems much harder to do in your mind – when in reality you can make it happen. The good thing is, you’re going to be able to do just that by following the different steps below.

### Set The Intention

To begin with, you’ll want to make sure that you are being intentional about your writing. It’s not enough to just say that you dream of being a writer. It can be [overwhelming](https://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/how-to-breakthrough-overwhelm.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at first, but you need to set the intention. When you decide that you’re going to be a writer and that you’re going to write a book, you have a much better chance at making it happen.

### Make It A Habit

The next thing you need to do to make this work is for you to create a writing **habit**. Because writing isn’t just going to happen by itself overnight. If you want your book to be written, you need to write it! And the best way to make sure that you get to that stage is for you to [make it a habit](https://writetodone.com/five-ways-to-build-the-writing-habit/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. If you can write for an hour every morning or an hour every evening, this will set you on your way. Whether you choose a period of time or a daily word count, it’ll help you to get the book written.

### Love Your Story

From here, you then need to make sure that you really love the story that you’re creating. If you’re going to give your all to writing this book, you need to believe in it. And that means loving the story that you’ve created and seeing your characters through to the end. When you can do that, you’re onto a winner.

### Perfect Your Craft

It’s also important for you to make sure that you’re always working on your craft. It’s not always easy to know how best to approach your writing, but you can turn to resources like [Jericho Writers' guide](https://jerichowriters.com/hub/get-published/developmental-editing/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to help you. Having a strong story to tell, with a writing style that you have perfected, will improve your chances of telling it well. If you’re not sure that you’ve nailed your writing technique, keep practicing and perfecting - "practice makes perfect" as they say.

### Get It Finished
 
Now, we all know that editing is a huge part of perfecting a novel. Yet, it’s not something you have to worry about until you have your first draft ready. It’s more important to get your book written and finished before you try to make changes. Otherwise, you may find that you get stuck on the same sections and never get it finished. But if you persevere and finish the book, then you’ll be ready to shape it up into the finished product and get it out to agents or go down the self publishing route.
