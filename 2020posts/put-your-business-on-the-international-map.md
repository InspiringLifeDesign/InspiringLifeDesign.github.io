# Put Your Business On The International Map

### Being a global [business](https://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/what-new-side-hustle-should-you-start-this-year.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is not easy. Most business owners reading this post are likely to be running a local business, seeking to expand and grow, perhaps with the aspiration of becoming a global business. 

A business can be hard to run and grow, and if you're only appealing to a certain set of people then it can pose certain challenges to growth. There are different types of local businesses. For example, one type of local business might be a cafe with a few regulars and passing trade who survive as a business, but have limited possibilities for international growth. Another type of local business might be an online local supplier that's ready to go global, perhaps selling parts or products to customers. 

Going global comes with its challenges. There are more logistics to manage. Small businesses who are used to serving a local or national market, may find the added complexity of international business overwhelming. So when it comes to taking your business to an international level you need to think about how you're going to serve a global audience and make it work for your existing business as usual activities. If expanding into a global market is on your list of things to do, read on for more information.

### Finding An International Audience
One of the first things you need to do when contemplating expanding globally, is to do some research into whether there is an overseas market for your product or service. It's possible that there are already well established competitors in the market you are trying to break into, or that there simply isn't demand for your offering due to cultural or geographical differences. 

Another challenge with expanding into a new country is that you will essentially be starting from scratch. Your brand will not be a known brand, potential customers will not know who you are, and they may be wary of the company being based in a different country. One solution that can ease this challenge, is to make use of a [virtual office](https://physicaladdress.com/virtual-office-new-york/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} with an address local to the country you are breaking into. Virtual offices are now prevalent around the world, allowing you to establish status in that area. This then allows you to use marketing methods in that country, further putting your business on the map. 

Of course another key thing to check is that your brand name is available legally to use in other countries. Your brand name and any slogans or taglines should be checked to ensure that they translate well. There have been some unfortunate examples of businesses who did not check in advance with some frankly hilarious outcomes. Take KFC who made Chinese consumers nervous when "finger licking good" was translated as "eat your fingers off", or Clairol who launched a curling iron into Germany called "Mist Stick" even though "mist" is German slang for manure!

You then have to figure out everything else that comes with trading internationally. You'll need to find trade routes, follow rules and regulations as well as laws, and ensure there is support for customers all over the world. 

### Understanding Risks
There are [so many risks](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-to-calculate-business-risk-393472){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} that come with trading internationally, and one of the main ones is that there is always the risk of delays, and delays cost time and money. 

Before you consider going international, you should grow your local business nationally first, to become a big and well-established business. This should put you in a position where you have sufficient funds to cover different eventualities and being prepared for the things that can go wrong along the way. 

Going international may offer more opportunities for your business in terms of profit, but remember that costs will be higher, you will need to ensure that you have a sufficient cashflow to make it worth your time. Importantly, when expanding globally, you need to liaise with professionals to make sure that you're following all of the rules and regulations for different countries, or your business could wind up in a lot of trouble. 

### Managing Costs 
Finally, you need to be able to manage the costs of your business so that you're making money more than you're spending, which is what a lot of businesses who trade internationally fail to do. To manage costs you could hire a financial advisor specialising in business costs management to make sure that you stay on track. Always account for losses and try and make them up the next month.
