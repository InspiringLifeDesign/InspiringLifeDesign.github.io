### There are many people out there who want to own a property, but given the amount of time, energy, and money involved in this process, doesn’t it seem like this could be a little...unambitious? 

Now don’t get me wrong: it’s an achievement to buy any property. But when you set out to begin the process, it’s a good idea to have grand ambitions in mind. Reach for the moon, and you’ll land among the stars, so they say. In this post, I'm going to take a look at some useful tips that’ll push you in the right direction when it comes to identifying and buying your dream home. Take a read, incorporate them into your search, and you’ll end up with a property that you love inside and out.

### What’s the Motivation?
If you want to end up in a property that you love, then it’s best to think about what’s motivating you to buy a home in the first place. Thinking what’s driving you below the surface can sometimes be quite revealing. For example, you might find that you’re drawn to one type of home for the social status that comes with it, rather than because you legitimately like the style and so forth. Buyer’s remorse is a big problem among homeowners, so it’s important to think about these things before you get too deep into the process. 

### Needs Versus Desires
Another good idea is to think about your wants and your needs. There’s a subtle but powerful difference between these things. The ‘needs’ are the things that your home must have; the desires are the things that put the cherry on top of your home. There will be a lot of homes out there to choose from -- you have to find a way to narrow down the search somehow! And this is how you can do it. If a property doesn’t have one or two of your ‘essentials,’ then it’s not the home for you. Now, since this is your dream home, you can be a little more forthright with your requirements, though you’ll want to stay realistic too. 

### The Wider Area
It’s not just the property that you’ll be buying; you’ll also be investing in the wider area too. As such, it’s important that you take a look at the neighbourhood nearly as closely as you look at the home. You might love your home, but if you have doubts about the wider community, then it can’t be your dream home, it’s more or less as simple as that. It’s likely that you’re looking for properties in areas that you already know, but if that’s not the case, then make sure you’re spending a considerable amount of time [exploring the area](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/78765/11-smart-things-look-new-neighborhood){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. If you’re not so into the local area, you may be willing to overlook its shortcomings in order to get the home that you’ve been looking at -- but my advice is: don’t ignore that inner voice. It might seem like no big deal when you first move in, but it will become an issue at some point or another if it’s a place that you don’t think you’ll connect with. 

### Stay Patient
It’s pretty exciting to decide that you’re going to buy a property, and that’s a good feeling, certainly the correct one. However, it’s important that you’re not getting too carried away with your enthusiasm. If you do, then you’ll be liable to commit the mistake of rushing into purchasing a property. And that can be a big mistake. Even if you think you’ve found your dream home at the very first time of asking (the first home you visit), it’ll be best to slow down and see a few other properties first before committing. It’s better to run the risk of losing out on a good property, rather than to jump into purchasing one property and then coming to regret it.

### A Fair Price
The perfect home exists, and don’t let anyone tell you any different. The issue is that you might have to spend millions to acquire it. It’s an unwritten rule that when talking about your dream home, I'm talking about one that works [within your budget](/posts/how-soon-will-i-be-financially-free.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. If there’s one thing that’ll have you regretting your decision, it’ll be spending much more money than you can afford. So try to strike the right balance between the home of your dreams, and what you can afford. There are, of course, many ways to help reduce the expenses. One is to save up a bigger deposit than usual. Another is to use the services of a [mortgage broker](https://thinkplutus.com/mortgages/guides/why-use-a-mortgage-broker/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, who will work with you to get you the best deal on a mortgage. 

Once you’ve established your budget, you can do yourself a big favour by simply sticking to it. Some people decide to stretch their budget once they find a property that ticks an additional box, but this is a clear recipe for regretting the purchase. 

### Five Years Down the Line
Remember that you’re not just buying the home for the here and now. You’ll stay in your property for many years; probably somewhere around ten years. So when you’re thinking about what your dream home would involve, think about where you’ll be five years down the line. Will you have more children? Will you want to live in a suburb, city, or nature? Just thinking about these questions can help to move you in the right direction, and push you towards a home that you love now and in the future. 

### Give It Time
Finally, remember to [give it time](https://www.consulting.com/how-to-be-more-patient){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} once you move in. If you’ve done things correctly, then you can have faith that you’ve bought a dream home -- but it’s not as if everything will run completely smoothly at all times, especially during the early stage of the move. You’ll still have to go through all the usual stressful moments associated with moving home, and there are no guarantees that you’ll be in love with the home from the first moment -- it’ll come!
