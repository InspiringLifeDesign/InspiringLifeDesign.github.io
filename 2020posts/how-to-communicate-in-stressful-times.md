### With the pandemic in full swing, many people are feeling on top of each other living and working together under the same roof. This can create tensions, especially when certain habits interfere with important tasks, like child care or work. 

It can, however, present an excellent opportunity for us to learn how to communicate more effectively and benefit from it further when the pandemic ends. 

Here are five ways to improve your communication with friends and family.

### Accept People for Who They Are 
We all know someone who is difficult to be around or communicate with. This is even more apparent during the pandemic, where we are all living so closely together. Whether it's a friend or family member, it's important to remember that they are a different person with different issues from you. They may be difficult for you to handle but understanding that they have their own circumstances to deal with, such as in the case of a bereavement where they may be worrying about making arrangements with a [funeral directors](https://www.oharafunerals.co.uk/bournemouth-funeral-directors-burials-cremations/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, is important. It's the first step to creating harmony between you. 

### Turn Negatives into Positives
Do you know someone who makes negative remarks about you in their presence or expresses a low opinion of you? It can be easy to slip into reactive mode with them, but this will do you more damage than good. Instead, use their negative comments to understand more about yourself. [What emotions arise for you](https://tinybuddha.com/blog/how-to-deal-with-negative-people-or-difficult-people/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and what do those emotions mean? If you reflect enough on these questions, you will learn a lot about what really makes you tick, and the comments will no longer have any effect.    

### Don't Take it Personally  
Sometimes people say things in the heat of an argument when passions are running high. The comments might be hurtful but try not to take it too personally, at least initially. After you have both calmed down and reflected on the situation, you can talk about it. Ask the person if they really meant what they said; chances are they didn't, and you stressed for nothing. Stepping away from hurtful comments and difficult emotions is one of the best and most skillful ways to handle spontaneous arguments.  

### Be Aware of Your Emotions 
Another extremely beneficial practice is to become aware of your emotions, especially when you feel negative emotions arising. If you feel anger, frustration, or stress coming up, it can be very helpful to label the emotion. Tell yourself that anger is arising. It will name the emotion, separate it from your mental state, and allow it to pass without any issue. In this way, you can control all your emotions, both positive and negative, at any time.

### Communicate Effectively 
[Communication](https://www.wikihow.com/Practice-Nonviolent-Communication){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} can be anything. It can mean screaming at the top of your lungs, for instance. But effective communication is far more constructive and meaningful. If you're living with someone in close quarters and you're not getting along, try talking to them about your habits. A good way to do this is using the line: when you do this, it makes me feel this way. Remember, the goal is to understand what makes each other tick, so that you can be sensitive to each other and ensure a happy household.
