### Being financially free is becoming more and more achievable every day. Thanks to the world we live in of social media, more people are finding that the job they thought didn’t exist for them actually does. Or they’re creating those jobs themselves. 

You’ve spent years building a business, you may find that you don’t want to take a step away. Maybe being present and managing your business yourself is the dream but if you’re dreaming of long vacations then start thinking about steps you can take to be able to become financially free. 

Decide what the dream or true goal is. If it is having a self sufficient business then having great staff and people you can trust is absolutely key. If you can’t step away from your business without constantly worrying about it then you have to make some changes. Finding people to work for you that you can trust with your business is hard. But having good training practices and a [Free Learning Management System (LMS) Directory Listing](https://elearningindustry.com/advertise/products/ppc-lms-learning-management-system){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in place can help with that.

Understand your business and or your product. If you understand your business and what you want it to become then you will know what to focus on. Figure out your demographic and learn how to bring in and gain repeat customers. When you know your customer you can create a successful marketing strategy. Today’s market is very competitive, consider who your competitors are and think about how you can offer something slightly different. Consider how you will create demand for your product and price accordingly.

Slowly phase yourself out or make yourself redundant. Of course it might sound strange and will definitely feel strange to phase yourself out of your own business but if your business can’t run day to day without you then it’ll never provide that financially free lifestyle you want. Particularly if you’ve built your business up yourself then there will be lots of people reliant on you. Whether it’s customers who are used to coming directly to you, or staff who always come to you with a problem. Encourage your staff to start problem solving themselves and start slowly taking steps back. You’ll quickly get an idea of what areas you need to work on most.

Make sure you have a good online presence. Utilise the social media platforms and make your [website stand out](https://www.simplesite.com/pages/receive.aspx?target=ftp3:crea&culturekey=en&partnerkey=ffgoogle:EUR_GB_EN_Search_WebsiteBMM_MakeWeb_CampaignID=6494554696_AdGroupID=78742614140_MatchType=b_Keyword=%2Bmake%20%2Bweb_KeywordID=kwd-22076653137_Device=m_Network=g_Geo=1006965_Gclid=Cj0KCQjw7ZL6BRCmARIsAH6XFDKXKpQJAtrhSAaUTey1zYSYq51oDmjwAKsflxb3un38mPWIjtrEdO4aArNiEALw_wcB_Position=_455705549459&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7ZL6BRCmARIsAH6XFDKXKpQJAtrhSAaUTey1zYSYq51oDmjwAKsflxb3un38mPWIjtrEdO4aArNiEALw_wcB){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. If your business is small you may not need a huge team of people for it to run successfully. A good online presence and a core team will see things run smoothly.  One of the biggest problems businesses see when the boss steps away is a lack of continuity. Make sure this isn’t going to be a problem for you by making sure your team has clearly defined roles and empower them to make decisions and find solutions without you. Taking these steps to help the business function without you ensures your business will thrive in the long run and will see it make money for you, even when you are not there. Meaning you can live the financially free life you've been dreaming of.
