### If you're regularly hitting the bottom of your bank account days (or even weeks) before payday, then it’s time to take control of your personal finances. 

There are some simple steps you can take to quickly and effectively manage your money. Below, I’ve outlined the top five, so you can take charge in 2020.
 
### 1. Make a budget
 
This is the first step to managing your money and if you’ve never made a budget before, then today is the time to start. It’s how you’ll see exactly what’s coming in and going out of your account and can keep control of it. If you don’t know which dates your direct debits are due, and you can’t accurately outline where your money is going, then putting it down on paper will give you an idea of where exactly you’re going astray. Use [these guidelines](https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-make-a-budget-1289587){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which will make it straightforward.
 
### 2. Give yourself short and long-term goals
 
You may be planning for [financial freedom](https://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/how-soon-will-i-be-financially-free.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, or you might just want to save for a fabulous holiday, new car, or to have something in the savings account for a rainy day. Whatever it is, set yourself some financial goals that you can use as inspiration to stick to your plan and your budget and keep things moving in the right direction.
 
### 3. Be kind to yourself
 
It’s pointless setting super strict rules for yourself – ‘I’ll never spend again,’ ‘I’ll do my food shopping on £6 a week’ etc. You’ll find it impossible to stick to and, what’s more, you’ll resent saving or paying off debt if you’re making yourself absolutely miserable in the process. There’s nothing wrong with a little cutting back to make ends meet, but if it’s affecting your personal life significantly, then assess whether you’ve trimmed too much off your personal allowance. Consider the rule of thirds – 1/3 for bills, 1/3 savings and 1/3 personal. This might shift about a little (Christmas is an obvious example of a time when the savings third might go out the window) but generally, try and stick to this rule.
 
### 4. Make more money
 
After you’ve created your budget, you might find that your outgoings exceed your incomings, especially with giving yourself a reasonable spending allowance each month. If that’s the case, it’s the time to consider bringing in some more money. There are lots of part-time, low stress jobs or alternative ways of making money that can increase your income. Some people find that foreign exchange trading works for them, think about [MetaTrader 5](https://www.fpmarkets.com/platforms/mt5){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} if this appeals. Or, if you’re looking for other avenues, try tutoring sites that operate in your area. You could consider self publishing books, or creating products to sell in an online shop.
 
### 5. Use apps
 
Use technology to help you achieve your goals. Try out [an app to help you save money](https://www.moneyexpert.com/news/top-5-apps-help-save-money/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Some round up to the nearest pound and put that in a savings account, others assess where you could cut back. If the first one isn’t for you, try another one. It’s all about trial and error and finding what works for you.
