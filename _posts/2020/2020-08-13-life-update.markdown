### It's been a while. I know I've been missing in action, it's time for me to let you know why...

I finally managed to film my [next YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Om6In9XYFY&t=1s){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and get it posted this week. I've done a full life update, which explains why I disappeared off the radar earlier this year. Watch the video to get the lowdown, or if you just want the highlights, here's the bulletpoints:

- I got really busy supporting the second launch of the [Knowledge Broker Blueprint (KBB) course](https://deanandtonylive.com/reservation?source=ILDpostadverts&a=1899){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" rel="nofollow"} (*affiliate link*)
- Then I was busy helping my KBB Bootcamp students work through the course, fulfilling all the bonuses I offered
- In mid April I stepped back from all my online business because I was in my 3rd trimester of pregnancy. I had a lot of medical appointments to go to, plus I opted to self-isolate as the Coronavirus pandemic hit
- In late May I gave birth to our gorgeous baby boy, remaining in hospital until the start of June
- As any parent will know, the first months of having a newborn are like no other, I have been spending my time learning how to parent, getting very little sleep!
- I've been keeping myself entertained during feeds watching lots of YouTube videos and Instagram stories, as well as reading books about parenting

### So what's next for Inspiring Life Design this year?

- I'm hoping to attempt weekly videos on my [YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/c/inspiringlifedesign){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, but as a new parent I have no idea what to expect week on week. If baby needs me, that comes first - after all strictly speaking I'm on maternity leave until around May next year. 
- It's my aim to reach 500 YouTube subscribers by the end of this year (I'm currently at around 425), so if you fancy seeing more of my lifestyle and life design videos then do consider [subscribing](http://youtube.com/c/inspiringlifedesign){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - you'll be helping me achieve my 2020 goal!
- I have new ideas for what I want to cover, especially around the idea of life design. I'd love to explore how I can help people consciously design their lives for ultimate happiness, with an emphasis on goal setting, tracking and achievement
