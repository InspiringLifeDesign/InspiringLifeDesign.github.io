### I don't know about you, but I'm ready for lockdown to be done and for summer to get here - pronto!

It's nearly been a year of restrictions due to the Coronavirus and we're all fed up of it right? But it feels like there's a light shining at the end of the tunnel. We have a roadmap to our new future out of lockdown, and better yet, it feels like spring is well and truly on the way.

Which means it's a great time to take a stretch and ease ourselves out of winter hibernation.

### Feeling Anxious And "Squidgy around the edges"?
Those 12 months of mostly staying indoors have taken their toll. Lockdown lethargy, freezing cold weather and comfort eating has caused even the best of us to pile on a few pounds.

The thought of venturing out and being social may feel a little daunting right now. A million questions race round our heads. I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL! 

*How will we remember to be around others? What will the new socialising look like? Will my friends remember me? Will my clothes still fit me?! Can I still walk in heels? Heck, can I still tie my laces?! Will people be happy to go out, to talk, to get closer than 2 metres apart? When can I hug my parents again?*

Believe me I have been having all these thoughts and more. But I have found an unexpected solution to my anxiety. Something that I would never have thought could be a saviour for me.
> ***Solidarity in getting fit!***

It's a health and fitness community, filled with fabulous ladies of all ages, sizes and walks of life, working out together. Supporting, helping and encouraging each other to hit their goals. 

By focusing on my health and fitness, I have found a new level of confidence and self love that is preparing me both physically and mentally for going out into the big wide world again!

### Time To Take Back Control
It's time to take back conrol of our bodies ladies!

No matter where you're at right now, even if you struggle to get up from the sofa *(that was me just a few weeks back!)*, take a first step today. Even the tiniest of steps will start building momentum for you, and tomorrow it will feel a little easier.

You could start with going for a walk, or if you've been walking every day, make today's walk longer than the day before. Or set a timer and get stuck into some energetic cleaning to get your body moving, with some tunes pumping to get you going!

If you really want to get serious and feel fabulous for summer, then I would highly recommend making a time and money commitment to your goal. After years of trying to lose weight, nothing really changed for me until I put my money where my mouth was and bought myself an online membership with access to a coach and accountability community.

It's truly been a game changer for me. It could be for you too.

<h3><span style="color:#dddddd">I'm Not In The UK, Can I Still Join?</span></h3>

<h3><span style="color:#dddddd">How Much Does It Cost?</span></h3>
<span style="color:#dddddd">
There are a range of pricing options depending on which starter bundle pack you choose and how much workout equipment is included.
</span>
<span style="color:#dddddd">
You could get started from as little as £160 (or currency equivalent) for a full year's subscription and all of the great benefits listed above. That's the equivalent of just under £13.50 a month - you'd struggle to find a gym membership for so low, and it wouldn't include the great coaching and community you get with this Summer Countdown program.
</span>
<span style="color:#dddddd">
I can show you the different starter options so that you can make the right choice for you.
</span>

<h3><span style="color:#dddddd">Will I Get Results?</span></h3>
<span style="color:#dddddd">
Proof is in the pudding (or not in my case!) I have been working out following one of the programs since mid January and so far I have lost 14lbs (in 1.5 months). THIS WORKS! You have to make a commitment and put the effort in, but you have all of the support you need to get the job done.
