### There has never been a better time to take action and own your future!
I know it's been a really hard time for many people this past 12 months. I think every human on the planet has felt the effects of the global pandemic one way or another. Things have been tough both mentally and financially.

I don't want to dwell on the negatives today though.

It's your job to own your future. Your destiny lies firmly in your own hands. If you've felt the pinch this past year, or perhaps have suffered the pangs of uncertainty that come with job insecurity, then you may be wondering how you can protect yourself financially in the future.

Do you have a back-up plan? If not, it's time to make one!

I would like us to focus on the positives we can take from the current global situation and to look to the future with hope.

### Opportunity Out Of Crisis
There are things that have happened as a result of the pandemic that are actually pretty good.

The various lockdowns around the world have resulted in a massive shift toward more online business. With more time on their hands people have opted to take up new hobbies, or do home & garden improvements - learning everything they need to know from online courses or websites.

The demand for online learning has rocketed, which means if you're a supplier of online products that educate people you're in a very strong position.

### What Does This Mean For You?
This means that there is a huge opportunity right in front of you to become a provider of training or educational products that can be sold online.
You may think that this is not something that's possible for you, but I'm here to tell you it is.

Creating a digital product to sell online is something that ANYONE can do. It doesn't need to cost much money upfront and you can create a product with a little time, effort and using the knowledge or skills that you already have.

I am proof that this can be done. With no prior experience I created my first ebook to sell on Amazon Kindle, after which I learnt how to distribute it even further as a paperback and audiobook. This is just one example of a digital product, there are many others such as courses, group memberships, photos, music, picture presets, printables...the list goes on.

### Building Your Financial Security
One sure way to create your financial security is to save and invest money that you earn over time. However, today I want to talk about an alternative option, which is building a business for your financial security.

It doesn't have to be something that you quit your current job to do - it's something that you can start small as a side hustle and grow from there. But having some form of income generating business is a smart thing to do.

And the great news is, it's relatively easy to start a side hustle because there are so many tools (many of which are free to use) available to you online.

A great way to start a business is by creating a product or service to teach people a skill that you have. For example you could create a book to sell on Amazon, or you could create an educational YouTube channel, or you could create a course, or you could offer coaching and mentoring. There are so many possibilities for ways to make money using the existing knowledge that you already have.

### But How Do I Go About It Corinna?
I'm glad you asked! You can learn exactly how to do all of this and more from the very best in the self education and personal development industry: Tony Robbins and Dean Graziosi. They are hosting a <b>5 day live online challenge</b> to teach exactly how to build and launch your own digital product.
