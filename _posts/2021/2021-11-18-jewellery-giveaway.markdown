### I am beyond excited to be running my Candy Cane Countdown to Christmas season this year! 
You'll find me mostly on my [Corinna Phillips YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCRTrAyc43Xp6-zdR3aG0g){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} so if you love Candy Cane and Peppermint Swirl Christmas decor, with a good helping of Disney, then be sure to [subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCRTrAyc43Xp6-zdR3aG0g?sub_confirmation=1){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} so that you don't miss a thing!

In the run up to Christmas I will be posting all about Christmas home decor, how to feel fabulously organised for the season, and giving you a glimpse into how we celebrate Christmas in our household. I've always been a lover of all things Christmas, in fact you can read about how I even created [my own advent calendar](/posts/my-2018-advent-calendar.html){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} a few years back, just in case you can't wait for the rest of the series to get going!

### Candy Cane Countdown Halloween Edition
I have already posted the first vlog in the Candy Cane Countdown earlier in November, if you'd like to see how I decorated our home and what we did for Halloween, then this is for you!

### Candy Cane Countdown Giveaways
There are going to be several <b>Candy Cane Countdown Giveaways</b>, which makes me so happy! Seeing as this is the season of goodwill and giving, I am delighted to be giving away heaps of goodies throughout the Candy Cane Countdown. These are hand-picked items which I absolutely love, so I just know that you're going to love them too.

### My First Giveaway Is...
This really is very special. I feel hugely honoured to be giving away this cute little penguin necklace, gifted by the fabulous jewellery designer [Jana Reinhardt](https://www.janareinhardt.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.

This necklace reminds us to stay flexible whatever life throws at us, so that we can keep moving forward. What a beautifully meaningful gift this would make for Christmas.

Entirely handmade by master goldsmith Jana Reinhardt from 100% recycled silver, it's worth £95 and the dainty pendant measures 9mm high x 7mm wide. The pendant comes with a matching trace chain that can be worn at 16 or 18 inches. 

### What Makes This Jewellery So Special
There are many reasons why I love Jana's jewellery... it's made to order, uses recycled silver and solid gold and Jana doesn't use machine manufacturing she prefers the old traditional techniques of wax carving and fabrication to create her products. These traditional methods have no negative effect on the environment, which means that Jana Reinhardt is a more sustainable choice for jewellery lovers.

<br />
I'm all about taking whatever steps we can to help protect and support our natural environment, using ethically made jewellery is just one small change that we can make.

And all those small changes add up.

Jana Reinhardt is a small company, run by a husband and wife team: Jana Reinhardt and Ross Cutting. They are both master-goldsmiths; who are as passionate about hand making jewellery, as they are about animal welfare and green living.
