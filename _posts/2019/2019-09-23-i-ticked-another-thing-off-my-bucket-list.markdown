### I first wrote my bucket list down on paper about 2 years ago. Of the 48 things I have on it, I crossed 3 things off in August, and today I can cross off my 4th...

***

I'd always had a wishlist of things I wanted to see, do and achieve bouncing around in my head, but around the time I started bullet journaling is when I first made a written bucket list.

At the time of writing this post the list is 48 items long, but in August 2019 I crossed off my first 3 accomplishments:

1. A return visit to Las Vegas
2. Meeting Tony Robbins in person
3. Attending Tony Robbins' Business Mastery event

Given that I'd not crossed anything off my list in over a year this was pretty good going to get 3 in one month!

Today, I'm really excited to say that I'm crossing my 4th item off the list:

**"Be featured on a Podcast or YouTube channel"**

Today I have featured on the **[Personal Development Essentials](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/personal-development-essentials/id1434710031){:target="_blank" rel="nooopener"}** Podcast, hosted by [Agi Keramidas](https://agikeramidas.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I have become friends with Agi over the past year through the Tony Robbins community. Like me, he served on the crew at Tony's Unleash The Power Within event in London earlier this year, and more recently Agi joined my Knowledge Business Blueprint (KBB) Mastermind, which is exclusively for students of the KBB course who purchased it through me.

A few weeks back I visited Agi to learn from him what goes into making a podcast show, and while I was there we recorded an episode for his podcast.

We talked about my experiences of going to [Unleash The Power Within](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8KLeZcVvAk&t=181s){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} both as a participant and as a crew member; about the [Knowledge Business Blueprint](/kbb){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (*affiliate link*) and the Tony Robbins community; about [self book publishing](/posts/5-money-making-reasons-to-publish-books.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}; and about my passion to help people find [financial freedom](/posts/freedom-plan-part-1.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Of course, he was also keen to find out about my recent trip to Las Vegas where I met [Tony Robbins](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/){:target="_blank" rel="nooopener"} in person, as well as other fantastic online entrepreneurs such as [Dean Graziosi](https://www.deangraziosi.com/){:target="_blank" rel="nooopener"} (*creator of the KBB, best selling author, speaker and entrepreneur*), [Russell Brunson](http://www.russellbrunson.com/hi){:target="_blank" rel="nooopener"} (*Click Funnels founder & author*), [Stefan James](https://stefanjames.com/){:target="_blank" rel="nooopener"} (entrepreneur & founder of *[Project Life Mastery](https://projectlifemastery.com/){:target="_blank" rel="nooopener"}*), [Jenna Kutcher](https://jennakutcherblog.com/){:target="_blank" rel="nooopener"} (*podcaster, entrepreneur & photographer*) and [John Lee Dumas](https://www.eofire.com/){:target="_blank" rel="nooopener"} (*Entrepreneur on Fire podcast*).

I have to say that being on the podcast was a step outside of my comfort zone. I was nervous before and during the recording, but Agi was such a wonderful host that he put me at ease. In the end I really enjoyed the whole experience. It was just like having a chat about subjects that I really love.
