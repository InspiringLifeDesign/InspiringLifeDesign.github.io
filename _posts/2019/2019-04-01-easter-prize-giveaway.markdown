### Can you believe that it's April already?! It feels like only yesterday that we were celebrating the New Year, but now here we are with the first quarter already gone and Easter rapdily approaching.

March was an incredibly busy month for me. I took on more days for the part-time IT contract I started back in December, which left me little time for my side hustles. I was also busy every weekend (bad planning on my part!) The small amount of time I had left was focussed on making progress with my online book publishing side hustle. I desperately wanted to get a blog post or YouTube video out, but somehow the time slipped away. I am planning to do much better in April!

As you may know, I have been a member of <a href="https://ukmoneybloggers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK Money Bloggers</a> for a couple of years now. It's a wonderful community of content makers with fabulous blogs, podcasts and videos about finance related topics in the UK. If you want to know how to make, save or invest your money, then you'll find the answers you're looking for amongst the many friendly and informative sites.

This Easter, some of the <a href="https://ukmoneybloggers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK Money Bloggers</a> have come together to offer you the chance to win one of three M&amp;S Easter hampers. Three lucky winners will win an Easter hamper delivered before Easter. Keep reading to find out how you can enter.&nbsp;
