<br />
Are you thinking about buying **Launchpad** the new 2023 course by Tony Robbins and Dean Graziosi but wondering whether it's worth the money? This article is written for you!

The new 2023 Launchpad is the 5th program that Tony Robbins and Dean Graziosi have launched since the Knowledge Business Blueprint (KBB) first hit the scenes in 2019. The goal of Launchpad and all its predecessors is to get students up and running with their own self education product.<br />
There are 2 key purposes behind the program:
1. To give students the opportunity to delve into their true passions and share their skills and experiences with others who need help
2. To provide students with the know-how & tools to create an income doing something that they love

Since the 2019 KBB launch, thousands of students have completed the Tony Robbins and Dean Graziosi programs, and have successfully launched their products through the mastermind platform. More on that platform later!

But first, let's talk about the Launchpad course itself. 

Following the 2023 Own Your Future Challenge, Dean Graziosi presented the event-special Launchpad offer, which is what I'm discussing in this article. If you're reading this some time later the event-special bundle will no longer be available, but you will still be able to purchase some aspects of the Launchpad course and Mastermind membership at the present-day price.

### What is in the 2023 Launchpad bundle?
Here's everything that's included with the bundle:
1. The Launchpad course & interactive workbook
2. 8 weeks of virtual meetups to guide you through the course
3. VIP ticket to the virtual Launchpad Live event
4. "Rocket Fuel" bonus module
5. 3 months Mastermind Platform membership
6. 3 months access to Glo the mastermind AI tool

PLUS many of the Own Your Future Challenge speakers added additional bonuses to the above list.

The event special price for the above bundle is $997 or 3 monthly payments of $380.

So let's look at each of these in detail to see whether the $997 is worth it for you.

### 1. The Launchpad Course and interactive workbook
The [**Launchpad course**](https://ownyourfuturechallenge.com/enroll?source=ildpost&a=1899){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} (*affiliate link*) is what Tony Robbins and Dean Graziosi have created as the core training. Compared to previous iterations of their courses, this one has been completely reimagined and refilmed, giving particular consideration to the use of AI throughout.
The course includes the following modules:
<ul>
<li><b>Jump Start Module</b> - which sets you up with the framework for success</li>
<li><b>Module 1</b> - Building your "coaching confidence". By the end of this brand new module you'll identify as an expert in your own right</li>
<li><b>Module 2</b> - What to create and who to create it for</li>
<li><b>Module 3</b> - Creating a world-class offer</li>
<li><b>Module 4</b> - Getting your first sale</li>
<li><b>Module 5</b> - Getting consistent sales</li>
<li><b>Module 6</b> - Real world implementation</li>
</ul>

So what kind of business does Launchpad help you with? The answer is any kind of business that uses your existing skills and knowledge to teach and share it with others. For example workshops, courses, coaching, masterminds, mentoring, events, books, the list goes on!

What I love about the course is that it's broken down into small easy to implement chunks. The goal is to get you up and running successfully. Even if you've already got experience with your own products, there are lessons around marketing and sales that can help any business grow.

The course comes with an interactive workbook, which means that as you're working through it you can easily access relevant links to tools and extras.

The value of the Launchpad course alone is listed as $5,000 on the sales page.

### 8 Weeks Of Guided Coaching
If you need a bit of accountability for getting through a course this is perfect for you! In 8 weeks of interactive zoom calls Dean Graziosi and his team will walk you through the key actions you need to take as you work through the course.

There will be live role-playing exercises and lots of opportunity to connect with the supportive mastermind community.

This is a brilliant bonus to keep your momentum going, I recommend trying to complete one module of the course each week to fully benefit from the live mastermind calls, however if you fall behind don't worry - the mastermind sessions will still hold lots of value for you.

These sessions will have a lot of people attending (similar to what you will have experienced if you were in a VIP room for the Own Your Future Challenge) so if you prefer a smaller group setting take a look at <a href="#how-to-make-launchpad-even-more-worth-it">How to make Launchpad even more worth it</a> near the end of this post. Here you'll discover how to get your invite to a more intimate, expert led mastermind for free when you invest in the Launchpad program.

The value of the 8 weeks guided coaching by Dean is advertised as $1,997 on the Launchpad sales page.

### VIP ticket to Launchpad Live
Over 3 days, this live event will take place virtually later in 2023. Tony Robbins, Dean Graziosi and lots of special guests will go deep on the next steps to turn everything you've learned from the Launchpad program into real, lasting success.

This is a fun, intensive 3 day event - if you liked the Own Your Future Challenge, or have ever done an Unleash The Power Within virtual, then you will love this!

The retail price for this event is $597

### Bonus module "Rocket Fuel"
This special bonus module from Dean's team is designed to help you scale your business once you have a proven technique for getting consistent sales.

Valued at $997 on the Launchpad sales page.

### 3 months Mastermind Platform membership

<br />
Membership of the mastermind platform gives you the ability to host your products and offer them for sale in the marketplace. In addition to this, there's a wealth of training included within the platform that gets updated regularly and a thriving community to connect with. If you're looking to find other entrepreneurs in a similar niche or situation to yourself, this is the place to find them.

The regular monthly price for the mastermind platform membership is $47

### 3 months access to "Glo" the AI tool
<center>
    <img src='/i/2023/glo-ai.png' alt='Glo is the AI tool which you get 3 months use included with the Launchpad program'>
</center>
<br />
This is a totally new addition to any of Tony & Dean's offerings. They've created an AI tool (think of it like a specialised wrapper to ChatGPT where it's been brought fully up to speed on Dean's knowledge and teachings in the industry). You can use Glo as your assistant to get you out of staring at a blank page not knowing where to start. There is an accompanying workbook so that you don't get stuck with how to talk to Glo!

Glo is part of the mastermind platform offering, so comes included as part of the $47 per month mentioned above

## So is Launchpad worth it?
If you tally together the costs of all of the above items that make up the Launchpad offer bundle, the total is $8,732 and that doesn't include the value of the Own Your Future Challenge guest speaker bonuses that were added (from Chalene Johnson, Trent Shelton, Rachel Miller and more...). That means on face value you're immediately making a saving of at least $7,735.

Another way to look at it is that the very first course offering that Tony & Dean launched in 2019 was $1,997. That means the price for Launchpad is half what the original course cost, but with lots more bonuses than were offered in 2019!

I have completed the Knowledge Business Blueprint (2019), the Knowledge Broker Blueprint (2020) and Project Next (2021) and can hand on heart say that Tony & Dean's event special offer price is one of the best value bundles I've seen. The modules are easy to follow and you have the workbook to take your actions in (yes there's homework to do!). Plus the amount of guided tutorials that get into the nitty gritty of marketing, social media advertising and sales is next level. I knew I had a tool for life once I did this course because it's something I can dip back into as a resource over and over.

In my opinion the Launchpad event offer is 100% worth it. I paid £1,997 for an online mindset course earlier this year which didn't even come with any bonuses, nor was it created by the top experts in the industry that you have in Tony & Dean. So £997 feels like an absolute steal to me!

### Is Launchpad worth it for your specific circumstances?
This is the most important question. The Launchpad program, like any other course or mentorship is only going to help you if you're ready to take action on the things that you learn. That means being brave, taking a leap of faith, and implementing.

The good news is, you've got the master of conquering your fears Tony Robbins behind you. In fact there's an entire module dedicated to getting you in the right mindset, to overcome your fears.

I would recommend asking yourself these questions to help you decide if this program is right for you, <i>right now</i>:
<ul>
<li>Do you have a desire to create a side hustle or income stream of your own?</li>
<li>Is the product or service you have in mind based around educating others? <i>If it's not, could you introduce a course, book or workshop to teach your product or service to others as a sideline to your business?</i></li>
<li>Are you looking to create a course, event, mastermind, paid community, book or workshop to share what you know?</li>
<li>Are you ready <b>now</b> to dedicate the time that it will take to learn and create your product? <i>The Launchpad may still be right for you if you can't start right away, but the live bonuses won't wait for you. You don't need the bonuses to succeed at a later date, it's just something you might want to think about before investing this year</i></li>
<li>Do you already have an education product for sale, but need to improve your marketing or sales?</li>
<li>Do you want to scale your existing education based business?</li>
</ul>

If the answer to any of the questions above is "yes" then the Launchpad is probably for you.

### How to make Launchpad even more worth it
If you run a business already, or are serious about creating one to pursue the things you learn from Launchpad, then you should consider whether it's viable to put the cost of the course through your business accounts. This can have tax advantages depending on the country you reside in.

Another way to get even more value for money is to purchase Launchpad using [**this link**](https://ownyourfuturechallenge.com/enroll?source=ildpost&a=1899){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} (*affiliate link*). I'm a strategic partner with Tony and Dean to get the message out about their online programs. I receive a commission when a student makes their purchase through me. I like to **pay this back to my students** by offering a great bundle of bonuses at no extra cost.

If you're reading this while the Launchpad event price is still open (this is likely to be about a week after the end of the Own Your Future challenge), then consider purchasing using this link and get all these extra bonuses through me:
<ul>
<li>6 sessions of my Mastermind Mentorship Group coaching</li>
<li>HELP! I'm scared of AI workshop</li>
<li>HELP! I'm scared of VIDEO workshop</li>
<li>Money Master The Game by Tony Robbins (paperback or kindle)</li>
<li>Millionaire Success Habits by Dean Graziosi (paperback or kindle)</li>
<li>Your very own professional Accountability Buddy for 75 days, with David Bee host of the IDKWTF Podcast</li>
</ul>
