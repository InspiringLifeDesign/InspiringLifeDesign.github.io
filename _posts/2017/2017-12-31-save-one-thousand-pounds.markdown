### Looking ahead to 2018

As the old year draws to a close, it's a great time to look ahead to the new year. Over the next few days I'll be reviewing how well I did at achieving my goals from 2017, then I'll be setting some new goals for 2018. This is an exercise I carry out at the end of every year to get me feeling excited and energised for the new year.

### Thinking about financial goals for 2018

I always have some financial goals on my list. Striving for income independence and ultimately financial independence is never far from my mind. Some time ago I stumbled across an idea on Instagram which I absolutely loved. It had the intention of encouraging you to save additional money over the course of a year by a simple visual tool. 

I'm a big believer in **gamification** - _the art of turning every day chores or tasks into little games_ to make them more appealing. This chart feels like the perfect way to add a bit of **fun** to saving, which can sometimes feel like a dull and unpleasant task.

### Challenge 2018!
The chart I found encouraged you to save **$1,000** in a year by splitting this down into 52 more manageable chunks of money to be saved. Building up your pot of savings one week at a time, adding to it bit by bit.

I decided to create my own British pounds version of the chart to use in 2018.

![How would you like to save an extra £1,000 in the New Year Challenge 2018 Chart](/i/2018/challenge_chart.jpg){:style="margin: 0 auto;"}

Every week I'm going to save an amount specified in one of the boxes, crossing off the money saved as I go. The amounts can be saved in any order, so if it's a bad week I can save as little as £1! 

### I'm opening up this challenge to YOU!
Would you like to join me in saving or making £1,000 (or $1,000) this year? Perhaps you'd like to use the money toward a holiday, or your Christmas expenses next year. Or perhaps, like me, you are saving toward your own financial independence.

Since I'd love for you to join me on this challenge, I have created a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i1E-jIoObX94_FcJNrnCRZKrzkx1hG89UYs8aj-sd0w/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} version of this chart for you to use. There are several formats for you to choose from (on different tabs)...

In Pounds:
1. A spreadsheet version you can update daily online
2. A colour printable version
3. A black and white printable version

In Dollars:
1. A spreadsheet version you can update daily online
2. A colour printable version
3. A black and white printable version

I created the printable versions for anyone who may want to stick this up on a wall or fridge door, or even into a bullet journal.

I'm planning on updating mine in the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i1E-jIoObX94_FcJNrnCRZKrzkx1hG89UYs8aj-sd0w/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} and sticking a copy in my new Bullet Journal so that I can keep an eye on my progress wherever I am!

In order to use this chart, you will need to be able to access Google sheets (you can sign up for your own [google email address](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?service=mail&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2Fe-11-1505756f1d3ea4e19169ac43a009cd7c-d7683e716eb4588c9df79cfa25791b5a46a33096&lp=1&hl=en-GB){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} for free if you don't already have one). Once you have followed the link, you can then make a copy of the spreadsheet and then you will have full edit rights to your version. There are instructions at the top of the spreadsheet for how to make a copy.

### Tracking our success together
To make things a bit more interesting, I thought it would be fun to track our progress together. For this reason, I've set-up a [page](/challenge_2018.html){:target="_blank"} where you can view everyone participating in the challenge and their progress to-date. I really hope you'll join in!

3. Whenever you save a new amount (or as often as you choose to let me know) email me how much you have saved
