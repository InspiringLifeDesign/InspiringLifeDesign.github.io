### Hello and welcome to my website, designed to give you inspiration and guidance in how to <b>start making your own money</b> using different income generating activities.
***  
  
- If you could choose to set your own work hours from anywhere in the world, rather than working 40-50 hours a week for someone else, **would you?**
- How about **more free time** to pursue your passions and spend time with your loved ones?
- Does your job provide your sole source of income, and if it vanished would you be financially stretched?
- Would you like to be your own boss, with **freedom** to choose what you work on when, and how often?

If you answered **yes** to any of the above questions, then you're in the right place. **I'm here to help**!

### Allow me to introduce myself

![Photo of Corinna](/i/Cory.jpg){:style="width: 100px; height: 100px; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; float: left;"}
My name is <b>Corinna</b>, and I'm embarking on a journey of exploration and experimentation into ways of making money, without having to work for someone else. I want to become self sufficient and make money through my own independent means. No more working for *The Boss* or struggling through the daily grind of 5 days a week. I'm going to share all of my successes and failures with you, as well as recommendations for how you can get started with your own journey to freedom.

### So where did the idea for this site come from?

I've spent the past year reading financial blogs and books learning ways to escape the rat race. While I determined that it's possible to save and invest toward an "early" retirement within a period of 10 years if I worked hard and was super frugal, that still felt like a slow journey to pursue. So I began to look for alternative ways to make my dreams a reality sooner.

Having focussed on reducing my expenses as much as possible, the next thing to do was determine ways that I could achieve additional income. This led me to try a couple of income generating ventures, while still doing a full time work contract. The beauty of this was still having a regular income to sustain my desired lifestyle. The downside was the amount of time available to work on these extra income endeavours being limited to evenings and weekends, resulting in slower progress than I would like.

My journey toward "income independence" was born in April 2016, but I still consider myself near the beginning of an exciting and prosperous adventure into the world of entrepreneurial business. 

There are various websites and blogs documenting people who I consider have "made it" financially. They are already making the kind of money I have so far only dreamed of (we're talking thousands per month here). However I haven't come across any websites documenting entrepreneurs <b>just starting out</b>, effectively at the start of their business journey. There may be such sites, but perhaps because they haven't gained traction yet it's hard to find them. I've decided to document my journey from the beginning, so that other people can follow along and see how it's possible to start from nothing, building it up to great things. I intend to take this pursuit of money making as far as I can, I'm planning on big things to happen here - let's see just how huge this can get!

### Why have I chosen to share everything I do?
I have a couple of reasons for wanting to share my journey:

* First, I would like to document my progress - the good, bad and ugly, so that I can look back and see how I've been doing
* Second, I want to show anyone else in the same boat as me - sick of working 5 days a week for 2 days off - that it <b>IS</b> possible to escape. By first building one source of income, then adding more income streams over time. Eventually you will be generating enough monthly income to provide a safety net, which will enable you to take the plunge and focus on your new business ventures full time

### So how can I help you?
I will be sharing all the methods I use to make money as I find them. I'll be telling you the pros and cons of each money making venture and helping you to get started with your own "Freedom Plan". I will be here to help as you're starting out and I'm hoping that we can share ideas, tips and success stories to help each other succeed in our individual journeys.

My goal is to help <b>as many people as possible</b> to start making extra money, with a view to helping them <b>quit their jobs</b> as they become self sufficient - I sincerely hope that you will be one of them!
