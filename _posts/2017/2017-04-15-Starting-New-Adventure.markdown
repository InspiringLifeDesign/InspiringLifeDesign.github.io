Hello and welcome to my brand new website, designed to give you inspiration and guidance in how to <b>start making your own money</b> from lots of different income generating activities. 

<h3>Allow me to introduce myself</h3>
![Photo of Corinna](/i/Cory.jpg){:style="width: 100px; height: 100px; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; float: left;"}
My name is <b>Corinna</b>, and I'm embarking on a journey of exploration and experimentation into as many different ways as I can find for how to make money, without having to work for someone else. In short, I want to become self sufficient and make money through my own independent means - no more working for *The Boss* or struggling through the daily grind of a 5 day week. As I pursue my <b>2 year Freedom Plan</b> to become financially free, I'm going to share all of my successes and failures with you, as well as recommendations for how you can get started with your own journey to freedom.

<h3>So where did the idea for this site come from?</h3>

I've spent the past year reading financial blogs and books learning of ways to be able to escape the rat race. While I determined that it could be possible to save and invest toward an "early" retirement by age 50 (I'm currently 41), that still felt like a relatively long and slow journey to pursue, so alongside my saving endeavours, I started to look for alternative ways to make my dreams a reality sooner.

Having focussed on reducing my expenses as much as possible, the next obvious thing to do was determine ways that I can achieve additional income. This led me to having a try at a couple of income generating ventures, while I was still working a full time work contract. The beauty of this is that I still have a regular income to sustain my current lifestyle. The downside is that the amount of time I have available to work on any extra curricular endeavours is limited to evenings and whatever free time I can manage on weekends, ultimately resulting in my progress being slower than I would like.

My journey toward "income independence" was born around April 2016, but I still consider myself right near the beginning of what I hope will be an exciting and prosperous adventure into the world of entrepreneurial business. 

I've found that there are various websites and blogs documenting people who I consider have "made it" financially, who are already making the kind of money I have so far only dreamed of. However I haven't come across any websites documenting entrepreneurs <b>just starting out</b>, effectively at the start of their business journey. There may well be such websites, but perhaps because they haven't gained traction yet it's hard to find them. So I've decided to document my journey from as close to the beginning as possible - so that other people can follow along and really see how it's possible to start from nothing and build it up to great things. Beyond my 2 year plan I intend to take this pursuit of money making endeavours as far as I can, I'm planning on big things to happen here - let's see just how huge this can get!

<h3>Why have I chosen to share everything I do?</h3>
I have a couple of reasons for wanting to share my journey:

* First, I would like to document my progress - the good, bad and ugly, so that I can look back and see how I've been doing
* Second, and most importantly, I want to show anyone else out there in the same boat as me - sick of working 5 days a week for 2 days off - that it <b>IS</b> possible to escape and furthermore this can be done by starting off building your first side income venture, then adding more and more over time. Then eventually you have enough monthly income to give you a safety net to be able to take the plunge and focus on your new ventures full time

<h3>So how can I help you?</h3>
A key part of my plan is to share what types of possibilities there are for making extra money, telling you straight the pros and cons of each money making venture and helping you to get started with your own "Freedom Plan". I will be here to help you as you're starting out and I'm hoping that we can then share ideas, tips and success stories to help each other succeed in our individual journeys.

My goal is to help <b>as many people as possible</b> to start making extra money, with a view to helping them <b>quit their jobs</b> as they become self sufficient - I sincerely hope that you will be one of them! 

If you're interested in discovering new money making ventures as I uncover them, please sign-up for my email list - I promise no spam, no sharing of your email address, just plenty of great ideas, actionable suggestions and "how to" info straight to your inbox:

<h3>My 2 year Freedom Plan</h3>
To challenge myself and keep me motivated, I've created my "2 year Freedom Plan". This lays out a monthly income target which I need to hit, each month higher than the last. You can find details of the plan {here}. If I succeed in hitting all of my income targets I will be self-sustaining by ??? 2018

Each month I will share my progress toward my Freedom Plan target, letting you know which money making activities are proving the most profitable, so that you can replicate what I'm doing and enjoy the same success.

Ultimately I hope that I can inspire you to create your own Freedom Plan and we can take this exciting journey together.
