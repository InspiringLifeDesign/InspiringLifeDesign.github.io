In the journey of personal growth and life design, I’ve come to realise that success isn’t usually about grand gestures — it’s about the little things we do every day. One book that completely shifted my mindset around this was <a href="https://amzn.to/43lKO79" target="_blank">The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson</a>.

Reading it was a genuine "ah ha" moment for me. It made me see that the smallest, seemingly insignificant choices we make — the ones that are easy to do, and easy not to do — are the very ones that shape our future.

These seven little words became my daily mantra:

<b>"Easy to do, easy not to do."</b>

Simple? Absolutely. But deceptively powerful. That phrase now plays in my head like a broken record — especially in the moments when I'm tempted to skip the small actions that, over time, create real transformation. In fact, it’s become the glue that holds together my habit stacking routine.

<h3>What is Habit Stacking?</h3>

If you’re not familiar with the concept, habit stacking is the practice of linking a new habit to an existing one, making it easier to integrate into your daily routine.
<br /><br />
James Clear popularised this idea in <a href="https://amzn.to/42Rq8E5" target="_blank">Atomic Habits</a>, and it’s a concept I’ve come to embrace fully as part of my life design journey.

But habit stacking only works if you stick with it — and that’s where my mantra comes in.

<h3>How These 7 Words Show Up In My Day</h3>
<b>1. Taking My Supplements</b>
Every morning is a bit of a scramble — making breakfast, checking emails, prepping for the day ahead. It’s all too easy to skip my daily supplements like collagen, <a href="https://amzn.to/4jNiGzS" target="_blank">Udos Oil</a>, and <a href="https://amzn.to/454V7Oj" target="_blank">vitamin D</a>. But in that moment of indecision, I say to myself:

<i>“Easy to do, easy not to do.”</i>

And I reach for them. Because I know that consistency is key — not just for visible results, but for the discipline I’m reinforcing with each small action. Health is one of the foundations of freedom, and these little moments help me prioritise it daily.

<b>2. Using My Teeth Whitening Powder</b>
Here’s another tiny but meaningful one. My natural teeth whitening powder takes ten seconds to use. And yet, the temptation to skip it — especially when I’m short on time — is real.

Again, those seven words echo: “Easy to do, easy not to do.” So I do it.

Because over time, those 10-second moments add up to a brighter smile, stronger habits, and more self-trust.

<b>3. Working-Out When I Don’t Feel Like It</b>
I’m usually good at sticking to my workouts, but let’s be honest — motivation ebbs and flows. Some days, dragging myself to do 20–30 minutes of movement feels like a chore. That’s when the mantra really earns its keep.

It reminds me that skipping one workout isn’t just skipping one — it’s reinforcing the identity of someone who skips. And showing up, even for just 15 minutes, reinforces the identity of someone who honours her commitments.

Whether it's a quick line dance session or some strength training, I know that motion creates momentum — and these little decisions keep that momentum alive.

<h3>Why It Works</h3>
These words work because they speak directly to the compound effect. That idea that the smallest daily actions, repeated over time, create extraordinary results. As The Slight Edge says, success and failure aren’t dramatic events — they’re the natural outcomes of small choices made consistently.

What you do today matters. Maybe not in the moment, but in the long run, it’s everything.

That’s why this mantra is so powerful. It short-circuits the excuses and re-aligns me with the version of myself I’m working to become.

<h3>You Can Use This Too</h3>
If you’re trying to build better habits or stick with the ones you already know matter, try borrowing this mantra. The next time you’re about to skip something small — drinking a glass of water, putting £5 in savings, stepping outside for fresh air — whisper it to yourself:

<i>“Easy to do, easy not to do.”</i>

And then choose the version of you who does it.

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
Designing an inspiring life doesn’t require massive effort. It requires consistent, intentional action — usually in the form of these little, daily, easy-to-do things. I’m so grateful I discovered this mantra. It’s helped me stay consistent, build better habits, and trust myself more deeply.

Let’s keep doing the small things that make a big difference. Every day.
