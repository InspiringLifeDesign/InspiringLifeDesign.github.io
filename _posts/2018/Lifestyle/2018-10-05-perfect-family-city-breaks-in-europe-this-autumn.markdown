### If you'd like to get away this autumn for a few days to recharge your batteries, and don’t want to travel too far or can’t afford sunnier destinations, you don’t have to look further than some of the European cities for inspiration. 

There are plenty of great deals going with family travel cards sweetening the deal. Below you will find a few places you might consider visiting with the kids for a few days.

### Paris 
There’s nothing better than the [Disneyland Paris resort](https://inspiringlifedesign.com/posts/what-to-pack-to-get-most-from-dlp.html){:target="_blank"} to entertain your kids and create memories for life.

There's low-cost long term accommodation available in prime locations that will let you explore more.

Ljubljana is the former Green capital of Europe, and has loads to see for kids and adults as well. You can try the signature wine of Slovenia, hike up to the castle with the kids and see the shades of green, yellow, and red dressing up this town. Don’t forget to visit the lake Bled that can easily compete with a fairy tale scene from a theme park, yet is much cheaper to enter. 

### Vienna
While this destination is usually popular during the festive season, it's also fun to visit before the crowds arrive. Vienna has a ball season, plenty of theatres, and must-see buildings. You can also visit the Prater Amusement Park just off the [Prater Museum](https://www.wien.info/en/sightseeing/prater/prater-museum){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. The Zoom Children’s Museum has plenty of tunnels and interactive playgrounds to keep your little ones entertained and their senses stimulated. 

### Dubrovnik 
There are plenty of things to explore and discover in Dubrovnik. Go up in the cable car to catch some of the best views of the city from Mt Srd Lookout. The kids will love the thrill and the different stalls located on top of the mountain. You might also walk the old city walks, or visit one of the old churches. If you are lucky and catch some nice weather, you can also walk down to Banje Beach. 

### Budapest

There are so many things to do in Budapest, with 1,500 big or small museums to choose from. You can go up to the castle and the Fisherman’s Bastillon. Walk down to the ice rink and watch people having fun. Check in to one of the thermal spas that offer great swimming pools and hot spring water too. There are kids’ pools as well to keep your children happy. There is also a science museum for kids in Budapest, called the [Palace of Wonders](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274887-d277712-Reviews-Palace_of_Wonders-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, where children can get hands-on experience with science.
