### It's been a little while since I last posted. It was in November to be precise. I've had a very busy December (as always). For a bit of fun, here is a video I've made about my 2018 homemade advent calendar. I hope you enjoy it!

###### SPOILER ALERT!
###### If you'd rather read what I'm talking about (or perhaps you're at work or somewhere you can't easily watch), below you will find a list of the gifts I received in my homemade advent calendar...

### About the calendar
This was a three-way collaboration with my Mum and my sister. Between us we sourced gifts to go in advent calendars that we could open during December, to avoid the temptation of purchasing a costly advent calendar which hardly has any items in it that we would like. As the 3 of us know each other well we could cater our gifts to our tastes, and create a varied advent calendar which didn't just contain beauty items, or just alcohol items, or just chocolate...

### Would I do it again?
Absolutely! This was a wonderful way to lead up to Christmas, it was exciting to see what was wrapped up each day. I'm not sure that the cost ended up being that much less than a mainstream beauty advent calendar would have been, but it was a talking point among friends and family and I found this so much more fun than having a shelf-bought calendar.

Sadly I didn't keep a note of how much I spent on the 24 items I sourced for my Mum/Sister (12 for each of them), but I think it was in the region of £25-£30.

I would highly recommend having fun with this kind of homemade advent calendar if you have at least 1 other person to do it with.
