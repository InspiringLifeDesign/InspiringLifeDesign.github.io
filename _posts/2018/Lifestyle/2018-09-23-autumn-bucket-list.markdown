### This past week the weather has been cooling, getting windier and rainier by the day. I'd say we're definitely entering Autumn now, so thoughts are turning to the colourful season ahead.

***

I've already read several seasonal posts about planning for Autumn and things that people would like to do during this time of year.

The lovely Jo at [A Rose Tinted World](https://www.arosetintedworld.co.uk/autumn-bucket-list/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} wrote her own Autumn bucket list and kindly suggested I may like to join in with the trend, so I've given it some thought and created a list of things I'd really love to do. 

This is not intended as a must-do "To Do" list. I have enough of those already! Rather, this is my wonderful wishlist for Autumn. I'm not going to stress myself out trying to tick everything off, it's just nice to have an idea of things I'd love to do. I'll keep you updated on which ones I have a go at...


### My Autumn Bucket List

#### 1. Take a photo in autumn leaves
A few years back I went to [Westonbirt Arboretum](https://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-8j9ce8){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener"} just as the leaves had changed colours for Autumn. It was so pretty. I got some brilliant pictures. I'd love to get some more pictures in the red, orange and yellow leaves of Autumn. Perhaps we'll find another arboretum to visit, or if not, just a walk in the nearby local woods would be lovely.

#### 2. Sit in front of a fire and read a book
Sitting in front of a warming fire is simply one of my favourite things to do when it's cold outside. I've got a bit behind on my reading goal for this year, so it would be nice to take some time to get back into it.

#### 3. Try a pumpkin spiced latte
I'm not a massive coffee drinker, I tend to go more for tea. However I've heard so many people raving about pumpkin spiced lattes that I'd love to try one.

#### 4. Light an autumn scented candle
First I need to check to see if I already have any candles which have autumnal scents. If not I'll need to buy one! I'm really into scented candles at the moment so this should be an easy one for me to enjoy.

#### 5. Carve a pumpkin for Halloween
I had great fun carving a pumpkin for halloween a couple of years ago. I got my design off the internet and carved Tinkerbell. Combining my love of Disney and doing something creative like carving a pumpkin feels like a perfect autumnal bucket list item. I'd love to find another gorgeous Disney design to do this year.

#### 6. Eat toffee while enjoying the fireworks with family for bonfire night
When I was a little girl we used to go to a family bonfire night at my Aunty's where we were always given homemade toffee to eat around the fire. I have no idea how to make toffee and it's not particularly something I want to have a go at, but I do love [Thornton's toffee](https://amzn.to/2OIsIUc){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (<i>affiliate link</i>)! I'd love to buy a box for us all to share around the bonfire which I'm hoping my parents will host again this year (along with fireworks of course).

#### 7. Create a seasonal t-shirt design
I'm so excited that I've recently been accepted to the Amazon Merch program, which means that I can start designing t-shirts to sell through their print-on-demand service. I haven't created my first design yet, so I'd really love to get at least one t-shirt design uploaded during the Autumn.

#### 8. Go to a Christmas Fete
I love a good Christmas Fete. Last year I helped run a stall at my niece's primary school's fete. I'd love to go to a fete this year where I can actually wander round and see all the stalls rather than running one (although running a stall was fun in its own right!)

#### 9. Make hot chocolate with marshmallows
I love the scene in the movie [The Holiday](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457939/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener"} where they make hot chocolate before bedtime. As a special treat I love a good hot chocolate with whipped cream and marshmallows. I like to drink mine sat in front of the fire, possibly with some gingerbread biscuits. My favourite hot chocolate of the moment is [Hans Sloane Drinking Chocolate](https://amzn.to/2zoeYst){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (<i>affiliate link</i>) because it comes as small pieces of chocolate which you can either melt in hot milk or hot water. It makes a really chocolatey drink - delicious!  I may combine this bucket list item with number 10...

#### 10. Watch my first Christmas film of the year
The odds are that I'll be watching [The Holiday](https://amzn.to/2NyM0iu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (<i>affiliate link</i>) this Autumn. It's such a heartwarming, feel good festive film. There's a few Christmas films I love, but every so often I get a craving for a particular film, and right now it's The Holiday! This would be perfect to watch as the nights draw in and the weather gets colder.
