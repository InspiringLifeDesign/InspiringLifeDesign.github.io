### Halloween has been and gone, as has Bonfire Night in the UK. Before we know it we'll be at US Thanksgiving, Black Friday and into the Christmas countdown! So it's time for a look back at October, to see how my income and profit faired.

***  

On a personal note, October is a month of birthday celebrations for our family. My Dad's and my boyfriend's birthdays both fall in October, as well as our anniversary.

<br>
The family all went out for a lovely meal together at our [local Chef and Brewer restaurant](https://www.chefandbrewer.com/pubs/west-midlands/bear-inn/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" rel="nofollow"} to celebrate. Then on the day of my boyfriend's birthday we enjoyed a delicious dinner at [Marco Pierre White](https://www.mpwrestaurants.co.uk/our-brands/steakhouse-bar-and-grill/meriden/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" rel="nofollow"}'s restaurant in Meriden (sadly we didn't see Marco there!). We also went for a delightful afternoon tea at the peculiarly long-named [Hallmark Hotel Stratford-upon-Avon The Welcombe](https://www.hallmarkhotels.co.uk/hotels/hallmark-hotel-stratford-upon-avon-the-welcombe/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" rel="nofollow"} (why not celebrate more than once eh?!)

As the end of the month swung round we enjoyed watching the Halloween Strictly Come Dancing Special at my sister's house. My 7 year old niece absolutely loves the show, and is learning ballet and other forms of dance herself. On the evening of Halloween itself we welcomed over 140 *trick or treaters* to our front door (luckily we'd stocked up on sweets), catch a [sneak peek into our evening](https://youtu.be/hJAQwN3oPw0){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" rel="nofollow"} if you haven't already done so!

I ticked off another **2 items** from my [Autumn Bucket List](/posts/autumn-bucket-list.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in October  - this is going well so far! Only 4 out of 10 things left to cross off the list. Here's what I did during October:

- We visited **[Batsford Arboretum](http://www.batsarb.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" rel="nofollow"}** and I got some wonderful pictures in amongst the autumn coloured leaves
- We **carved pumpkins** for Halloween. My Disney obsession continues as I chose to carve Minnie Mouse, and my boyfriend carved Mickey. We also had one with a Star Wars rebel alliance starbird symbol, and another of a cat!

Here's some of my favourite pictures from October...

This is a recurring monthly post to track my goal of **earning at least £4,000 profit** from my Income Hustle ventures this year. 

My goal breaks down across the months and weeks of the year as follows:

**£4,000** per year or <br>
**£333.33** per month or <br>
**£76.92** per week

This means that my target profit for each month would ideally be in the region of £333.33. 

In August & September I made enough profit to hit the monthly target of £333.33. September's profit was particularly good at £465.18, which was **£131.85 over** my monthly target. 

For my overall 2018 target of making £4,000 profit for the year, my running total was sitting at £2,096.70 at the end of September. So hitting my annual target was looking to be a push. Question is, how did I get on in October? Read on to find out...

At **£732.34** that's another strong month for income in October. I nearly matched the same income I pulled in for September (just £29.82 short). My running total income for the year is creeping closer to £4,000. Once my income is over £4,000 it means there's a chance (albeit very small) that I might hit my £4,000 profit goal for the year.

Here's a break-down of where my income came from in October:

![October 2018 Income & Profit Report income pie chart](/i/income_report/2018/october/201810income_pie_chart.png)

Once again Kindle book sales were the clear winner for income production in October, coming in at £565.59. I had another decent month with blogging (£80), still reaping the benefits of the things I learned from [Turn Your Dreams Into Money](http://bit.ly/turnyourdreamsintomoney){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  (<i>affiliate link</i>) and [How To Smash Affiliate Marketing](http://bit.ly/smashaffiliatemarketing){:Target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (<i>affiliate link</i>). Paperback sales were pretty strong this month compared to usual, bringing in £50.83 compared to £38.32 last month.

Behind the top 3 income streams, I made small amounts of money from doing [**surveys**](/posts/cash-this-week.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (<i>affiliate link</i>), selling my unwanted items on eBay, and from cashback sites [**Quidco**](http://bit.ly/quidcosignup){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (<i>affiliate link</i>) and [**TopCashback**](http://bit.ly/topcashbackjoin){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (<i>affiliate link</i>).

There is no entry for audiobook sales for October because although I did make some sales, I didn't meet the minimum Amazon threshold for being paid. My royalties will be rolled forward to November, where hopefully I should have enough accrued to receive a payment.

</table>

It was a decent month for low expenses in October. At £134.39 costs were £162.59 less than the £296.98 I spent in September. There were two main reasons for this:

1. I had less book marketing promotions and advertising expenses in October
2. I decided to end the subscription membership that had been helping me with blogging, because I felt that I had learnt as much as I could from it for now

My annual expenses have now crossed the £1,000 threshold, at £1,067.42. 

October's expenses included book promotion costs, my zoom pro subscription for video calls that I'm using for my [**Publishin8 Course**](/signup/publishin8.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} live training sessions (which I'm logging as a blogging expense for now until I create a new "product" category) and eBay/Paypal fees:

As you can see, I made good profit again in October (**£597.95**) with a sizeable increase of £132.77 over the profit I made in September. This is impressive considering the fact that my income was actually *less* in October than September - it all comes down to my expenses being less.

In terms of my monthly profit target of £333.33, I easily achieved this with **£264.62** to spare.

With October's profit taken into consideration, my avergage monthly profit (across the last 12 months) is standing at £239.72. This is another improvement on last month, when the average was £200.63. Tracking the average profit gives me an indication of what I can consistently expect to earn from my income hustles, allowing me to plan for the future.

My overall profit for the year has gone up to **£2,694.65**, which is about £638.65 short of where it needs to be if I were on target to hit my £4,000 goal. With just 2 months left to go this year I'd need to achieve the following if I were to succeed in my annual goal:

- Profit target (per month):  £333.33
- Total profit deficit to make up: £638.65
- Total profit deficit amount to make up per month: £319.33
- **PROFIT I NEED TO MAKE PER MONTH: £652.66**

Being completely real, I think it's highly unlikely I'll hit the £4,000 profit mark, unless something extremely unexpected happens between now and the end of the year! However, I shall continue to press on with my income hustles throughout the next 2 months to try to get as close to my goal as possible.

#### What Actions Worked/Didn't Work From Last Month's Plan
In [last month's income and profit report](/posts/september-2018-income-report.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} I listed the things I would do in October to help improve my profit.
<br>
Here's a run down of how I got on:

##### Book Publishing
> ***Purchase book promotions** to run during October **and** November. With Black Friday in November I want to get ahead and pre-book my November promotions during October so that I can secure my preferred dates*
* <span style="color:green">**DONE**</span> I planned and booked all the promotions I intend to run during October *and* November

> ***Set a launch date** for my latest book and complete the necessary work to stick to this date! Including:*
  * ***Purchase stock images** for my latest book (these are stock images I need to buy that are in addition to the illustrations I've had done)*
    * <span style="color:green">**DONE**</span> I've finally completed this task which I'd been procrastinating on for a while. I think I'd been putting off doing this because I knew it would be a big/long job - and it was! So I'm really happy that I got this one done
  * ***Complete the editing** of my latest book so that it's ready for formatting*
    * <span style="color:orange">**50% DONE**</span> I made a good start but didn't manage to finish this
  * ***Work on the formatting** of my latest book to prepare it for publication in both Kindle and Paperback formats*
    * <span style="color:red">**NOT DONE**</span> I can't start on the formatting of the book until the editing is complete

##### Blogging
> *Carry out any **sponsored blog post** opportunities which I receive during October*
* <span style="color:green">**DONE**</span> I completed around 4 opportunities during October

> *Publish at least **4 new blog posts***
* <span style="color:green">**DONE**</span> I published 4 new posts during October:
    * [Perfect Family City Breaks in Europe this Autumn
](/posts/perfect-family-city-breaks-in-europe-this-autumn.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
    * [What Would You Do If You Were Given One Million Pounds?](/posts/what-would-you-do-if-you-were-given-1-million.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

    * [How To Complete The Editing of Your Ebook](/posts/how-to-complete-the-editing-of-your-ebook.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

> *Grow my [**Life Designers email list**](/signup/signup_page.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} from 10 to 12 subscribers*
* <span style="color:red">**NOT DONE**</span> I gained 1 subscriber, so my end of month total was 11

> *Increase the **domain authority** for [inspiringlifedesign.com](/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} from  15 to 17*
* <span style="color:green">**DONE**</span> I'm so pleased with this one, I managed to get my site up to DA 17! This is important because when you look to work with companies, one of the first few things they will check is the domain authority of your blog. From what I can tell, initial opportunities start to kick in around DA 20 but get better the higher the DA. Ideally I want to be in the 30's at least. So I've still a way to go, but this is great progress. The way to improve domain authority is to post regularly and collaborate with other sites with things like link swaps, guest posts and features

#### Things I Will Try This Month To Help Improve Future Months' Income And Profit

##### Book Publishing
* **Purchase book promotions** for the month of December. Now that I've got a month ahead with booking promotions, I'd like to stay at least a month ahead

* **Work on the formatting** of my latest book to prepare it for publication

##### Blogging
* Carry out any **sponsored blog post** opportunities which I receive during November

* Increase the **domain authority** for [inspiringlifedesign.com](/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} from  17 to 18

##### Courses
* **Gather half-way feedback** from the participants of my [**Publishin8 program**](/signup/publishin8.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
