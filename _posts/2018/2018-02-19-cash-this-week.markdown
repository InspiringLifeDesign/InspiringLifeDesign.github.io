### This month I've tried various money makers in an attempt to hit my income target (I talk about targets in my [**January Income Report**](/posts/january-2018-income-report.html)). 
### Here's one way to make some quick extra cash, without having to leave the comfort of your own home!

### Academic Studies

I have used various survey sites before and quickly given up on them because of getting screened out too many times.

![Prolific logo](/i/prolific_logo.jpg){:style="width: 214px; height: 81px; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; float: left;"}
However I was recently introduced to a survey site which hosts academic studies. It's called [Prolific](https://app.prolific.co/studies){:target="_blank"} and this has been a much more enjoyable experience.

Here's what the Prolific Website has to say about itself:
> Prolific Academic is the world's largest crowdsourcing community of people who love science. Researchers post studies and recruit the right participants fast. Participants earn rewards while helping to advance human knowledge.<br>
One important part of our mission is to empower scientific researchers by helping them recruit participants for their research.<br>
Another important part of our mission is to spread our passion for science. We believe there is enormous untapped potential in scientific crowdsourcing. We would like to leverage this potential in order to advance human knowledge and create a better society.

#### Ease Of Use
I found it very quick to sign-up and the surveys I have completed have been straight forward to complete. The longest I have spent on a survey has been about 15 minutes and the earnings per survey has ranged from £0.60 to £2.50.

This website feels safe to use and offers a simple but pleasant user experience - none of the flashing adverts or lack of information you get on other sites.

Once you are signed up there is a dashboard where you can view your account information.

Here you can see your *Balance* which is how much money you have available to withdraw right now. You can also see your *Pending Balance* where any money sits after you've completed a survey but the researcher has not yet verified your responses and released the money. So far it has only taken a couple of days for the money to move from pending into my available balance.

#### Getting Paid
What's nice about [Prolific](https://app.prolific.co/studies){:target="_blank"} is that the **minimum payment threshold is just £5**. You should be able to earn this in a week quite easily. The only thing which could hamper your earning potential is how many studies are actually available for you to carry out. I have made it a habit to check in at least once a day to see if there are studies available.

**HANDY TIP:** If you are able to check the Prolific Site during the day on week days this feels like the best time to find available studies.

Another thing you can do to help you get more studies is answering the pre-screening questions which are available. There were quite a lot of questions, but once it's done it's done!

To receive your money from [Prolific](https://app.prolific.co/studies){:target="_blank"} there is now just one payment method:

[Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/uk/invite?token=TyGgK0E2v40&program_code=Signup_Referral_Notification){:target="_blank"} (<i>affiliate link</i>)

Once you've initiated a payment it will take up to 5 days to receive the money into your account (but often less than 48 hours).

And that's it - **simple as that**. So consider signing up for [Prolific](https://app.prolific.co/studies){:target="_blank"} today and start making yourself some easy money!

#### Want More Surveys?
Of course there are many other sites which offer payment for completing their surveys, if you would like to find out more you should check out [The 10 Survey Websites You Should Be Signed Up For](http://makemoneywithoutajob.com/the-top-10-survey-websites/){:target="_blank"}.
