### Today's post is all about creating Side Hustle income from blogging. 
***  

### How Would You Like To Make A Six Figure Income Writing About What You Love?
I don't know about you, but I would! And that's exactly what fellow blogger Emma Drew does for a living.

That's why I couldn't resist buying Emma Drew's [**Turn Your Dreams Into Money**](http://bit.ly/turnyourdreamsintomoney){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} blogging course earlier this year. Its tagline is *How To Build A Six-Figure Blog And Live The Life You Want*. That's a bold sales pitch, so I have high hopes that this course lives up to expectations.

### Who Is Emma Drew?
I met Emma twice last year (in 2017). First at the [UK Money Bloggers](https://ukmoneybloggers.com/gallery-show-money-bloggers-3-2017-shomos/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} event in London where I attended one of the workshops which she facilitated. Then again at [Fincon17](/posts/Five-Biggest-Lessons-from-Fincon17){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} in Dallas where I also met her husband Tony. We had some great chats about blogging, seeking financial freedom and the law of attraction which we're both great believers in.

Emma has been blogging for over 7 years. At her award winning site [emmadrew.info](https://emmadrew.info/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} she writes all about **money making** and **saving money**. Alongside this she runs a YouTube channel, where among her many videos you will find a playlist called "What's Awesome in Poundland" which always proves popular.

Although Emma no longer produces monthly income reports, it's clear from the reports she published back in 2016 that she practices what she teaches! Her monthly income was never below 4 figures even back then, with her highest month listing at **£6,188.91** in October 2016. Since then Emma has launched several products, including her courses and a group coaching subscription programme. If she were still producing income reports today it wouldn't surprise me if she was hittng 5 figures every month! Just 5 years after starting blogging, Emma was earning a **6 figure income** and was able to quit her day job.

### My Experience Of The Course
As of the start of April 2018, I'm 30% of the way through [**Turn Your Dreams Into Money**: *How to build a six-figure blog and live the life you want*](http://bit.ly/turnyourdreamsintomoney){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} and I must say that so far I'm impressed! I have found the course very simple to follow, easy to implement and I've really enjoyed coming back to it each day to learn more. I have a long list of enhancements I want to make to this blog so that it is more enjoyable for you as a reader to navigate and get value from. Already I've come across new ideas and things which I should really be doing with the site, that I wasn't even aware of before!

I created Inspiring Life Design to share my story of seeking financial freedom and trying to help others do the same. Talking about money, self development and financial independence really fall under the category of "hobby" for me. It's what I love. So having a blog in this area does not feel like a chore, or even a money making venture - it's my passion. Having said all that, if I can find ways to make money from the blog, while maintaining my integrity and the mission of the site, then I'm most certainly going to give it a try!

I'm now reaching the modules in the course where it delves into how money can be made, so I will keep you posted on how I get on with it.

### All About The Course

#### Who is it for?
[**Turn Your Dreams Into Money**: *How to build a six-figure blog and live the life you want*](http://bit.ly/turnyourdreamsintomoney){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} is suitable for anyone completely new to blogging right through to experienced bloggers who are looking for ways to optimise their site. Even if you don't have a topic to blog about yet it doesn't matter, Emma delves into how to find your niche. If you're like me - you can just write about what you love, and make money from it at the same time!


#### What does it cover?
There are over 20 modules in the course. Each module is split down into bite-size lessons which you can work through in your own pace. As you complete each lesson, you're shown your percentage complete so that you can keep track of your progress.

Modules go in-depth into how the world of blogging really works and how to make money from it, covering topics such as:

- Setting up a new blog from scratch
- Writing kick-ass blog posts
- How to get traffic to your blog
- Making money from:
  - Sponsored posts
  - Affiliate marketing
  - Adverts
  - Your email list

The course content is delivered in a written format with lots of images illustrating the points being made. On the latest lesson I've completed there was also a video, this one explained how to improve Search Engine Optimisation.

Alongside the main course there is a workbook which you can download and print-out. I particularly love this part of the course. The workbook is on brand with Emma's lovely colour scheme (as is the course), and I know it sounds silly, but it does make me want to keep returning to fill it in!

#### What else do you get?
As well as the course itself, you receive an invitation to join the closed Facebook Group for course students. I have found this invaluable, because we support each other and help promote each other's sites. Emma is an active participant in the group and you have the opportunity to ask her questions as you work through the course.

On top of all this, there's also a bonus copy of **Blogging Your Way To Riches** by Lynn James and Emma Bradley included with your purchase. I haven't read it yet, but I'm really looking forward to jumping into that after I've finished the course.

#### How much does it cost?
The usual course price is £197, but Emma has kindly provided me with a **discount code** to be able to offer you the course with **£50 off**, bringing down the total cost **from £197 to £147**. 

Having paid for coaching in the past which tends to run at £100+ per hour, this price really offers **great value for money**. Trust me, I have learnt the hard way, that to make money you inevitably have to spend some money first.

If you are interested in taking advantage of this great discount, simply use my code **SPRING2018** as you purchase [**Turn Your Dreams Into Money**: *How to build a six-figure blog and live the life you want*](http://bit.ly/turnyourdreamsintomoney){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}. This code can be used at any point in April 2018 to receive your £50 discount, but remember that the offer expires at midnight on 30th April 2018. Once you have purchased the course you have **lifetime access**, including any updates which Emma makes to it.

### Over To You
So do you think that blogging could be a good Side Hustle for you? It can certainly be very rewarding, and thrilling whenever you receive feedback from your readers. As with most money making ventures it will take some of your time to get it set-up and maintained, but the rewards are there for the taking!

If you have a blog, or are considering starting one let me know because we can share tips, links to each others blogs and frankly I'd just like to read what you're writing about!
