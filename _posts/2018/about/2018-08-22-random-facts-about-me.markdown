### I'm sure you've always wanted to know 20 random facts about me, well the wait is finally over...

Earlier this month I was tagged by fellow blogger Emma at [MyDebtDiary](https://mydebtdiary.info){:target="_blank"} in her [random facts about me](https://mydebtdiary.info/2018/08/08/random-facts-about-me/){:target="_blank"} post. I've never participated in one of these before and thought it might be fun to give it a go. So buckle up! Here are 20 random facts you never thought you'd hear about me...

### 1. When was the last time you cried?
I find I'm quite an emotional person, I cry very easily - sometimes more often than I would like. The last time I cried was earlier this week watching Beauty and The Beast with my niece. Any sad scene in a movie will get me!

### 2. If you were another person, would you be a friend of yourself?
Wow, feels like a deep question. I'm going to say yes, because I like to be friends with everyone. Can't see any reason why I wouldn't be friends with me!

### 3. Do you use sarcasm a lot?
Rarely. I never quite know how to take people who use sarcasm all the time, so I try not to myself.

### 4. What’s the first thing you notice about people?
Their smile (or lack of!)

### 5. Scary movie or happy endings?
Happy endings! I don't watch scary movies, they give me nightmares. I love a good Rom Com or Disney film.

### 6. Favourite smells?
Walking through a rose garden, the smell of freshly baked bread, coming home to a roast dinner cooking in the oven, the smell of crisp clean bedsheets, christmas scented candles with cinnamon.

### 7. What’s the furthest you’ve ever been away from home?
That would be my two trips to Australia. I've visited Sydney, Melbourne and The Gold Coast.

### 8. Do you have any special talents?
I play the piano and the violin. I used to be in the [City of Coventry Youth Orchestra](https://www.cwyo.org/){:target="_blank"} and once toured with them to Germany and the Czech Republic.

I also make a mean martini - I love experimenting with my own cocktail recipes. My favourite martini is a Cosmopolitan, though I'm famous for my butterscotch martinis!

### 9. Where were you born?
I was born in the same city as I currently live - Coventry, West Midlands, UK.

### 10. What are your hobbies?
I love playing games. I play backgammon and hearthstone online. With friends and family I enjoy board games and card nights. I also love reading [blogs of people who are on their journey to achieving FIRE](/blogroll.html){:target="_blank"} (financial independence, retire early). I still consider building this blog as one of my hobbies because I enjoy it so much, though of course it's now becoming one of my income streams too - bonus!

### 11. What did you want to be when you grew up?
When I was much younger I wanted to be a super hero. I used to imagine that I could fly. I made up a name for myself based on a flower name I saw on one of my parents' plant pots that I thought sounded cool...***Azalea***! I would run up and down the drive trying to pick up speed so that I could take off and fly! 

As I got a bit older I dreamed of running my own hotel or restaurant, which is what led me eventually to do a degree in Hotel and Catering Management.

### 12. How many countries have you been to?
I'm not sure I can remember them all! I've been to lots because I worked on cruise ships for 1.5 years and as part of that I went all over the place! I'm going to guess it's around 20 countries.

### 13. What was your favourite/ worst subject at school?
I hated chemistry. I'm not sure if I had a favourite subject - probably music or art.

### 14. What is your favourite drink?
Champagne darling! Or if we're talking non-alcoholic then it would definitely be tea - English Breakfast.

### 15. What would you (or have you) named your kids?
Hmmmm, not sure really. I like Darcy or Georgia for a girl. Elliott or Morgan for a boy perhaps. If I were to have kids I'd definitely get a book of names and look through for names that I like!

### 16. Who are some of your favourite YouTubers?
I feel like I'm still just discovering YouTube really. 

- I love watching [Casey Neistat's channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}
- Plus Casey's friend [Dan's](https://www.youtube.com/user/DanTheDirector1){:target="blank" rel="nofollow"} videos are good
- I also try to watch channels which teach me how to make money with book publishing or blogging. I've watched quite a few of Stefan's [Project Life Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKkg7omDlPvUPxLY-dho8Pg){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} videos
- I love watching [TEDx Talks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}
- I watch a lot of <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-9093862-12703194" target="_top">Tony Robbins</a> (<i>affiliate link</i>) videos, both on [Tony's channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/TonyRobbinsLive){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} and any others I find on YouTube

### 17. How many boyfriends have you had?
It's taken me a little while longer than some to meet "the one". I had 5 boyfriends before I met my lifetime partner, so I guess that makes 6!

### 18. Favourite memory from childhood?
I don't feel like I have one favourite memory really. I remember loving our family holidays to Sandbanks, Cornwall and France. I also loved being in a dance show where we got to wear costumes, I particularly loved the ballet dance where my costume involved wearing a tutu!

### 19. How would you describe your fashion sense?
I tend to favour monochrome and block colours over busy patterns. I hate grey though, so I rarely wear that colour.

This summer I actually really enjoyed buying some colourful floral and patterned tops so perhaps my style is evolving a bit! I really enjoyed wearing dangly earrings this summer, for years I've only worn studs and it was so refreshing to have a change.

I also really love the 1940's look, so on special occasions I will set my hair 1940's style and try to find a nice dress which looks vintage.

### 20. Tell us one of your bad habits?
Me? Bad habits? Never!

Actually it's probably getting stressed too often, or working too long when I should be chilling and having fun!
