### Sign-ups for #Challenge2018 have now closed. However, if there is enough interest I may run a new challenge later in the year. If you are interested in this please use the sign-up below:

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you sign-up for the next challenge your **name** and **amount saved** may be openly visible on my website (but your email address will never be disclosed or visible to anyone).
